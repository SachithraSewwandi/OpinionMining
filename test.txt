java is good for Object-Oriented-Programming
Object-Oriented-Programming is amazing
Main Object-Oriented-Programming concepts are encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction and inheritance
abstraction deals with the outside view of an interface
polymorphism is not bad
I would highly recommend Python over Java.
Java is almost always faster, but it doesnt matter.
The output image gets  worse if we block more of the frequencies.
