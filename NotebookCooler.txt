This is the second notebook pad I've purchased
The first one did not raise the notebook up at all so there was no airflow
This one is designed to allow airflow underneath the laptop
The fans on this model are not very powerful and you can barely feel the air moving
It keeps my Macbook Pro 214Ghz around 84 degrees
The previous pad I had stayed around 80 degrees
Functionally this worked great
Greatly reduced the heat generated from my laptop
Made it comfortable to work long hours with my laptop in my lapThat being said I used it daily and carried in my laptop bag occasionally
The plastic is flimsythe rubber feet fell out the housing cracked the cord is much too long which makes carring the laptop and chill pad together hazardous really easy to catch the long loop of cord on something
At the end of 8 months of use it was no longer operational and I had to pitch itIf they would just remanufacture it with some more durable materials and a shorter cord I'd give it 5 stars
Not Sure what the other reviewers are talking about
The product works & does cool
It is so quiet I kept checking to make sure it was working
But it's very small
I got a 14 inch laptop & it's a tiny bit too small
I would not recomend it for a 16 inch
I used it about 5 or 6 times maybe less than 10 hrs
before it just stopped working It is very cheaply made & wieghs about a 2 pounds or less
Please do not buy from sellers who are charging $60 for it
I paid $30 down at wal-mart for mine & feel "taken" after looking at better deals on Amazon this thing really is cheap & flimsy
I bought this item from Amazon about 1 month ago
Firstly it worked great completedly satisfy with this product
But now it makes too much noise
I cannot turn it on at night or in my office
I've had this product for just over 3 years and wanted to chime in because of all the mixed reviews
My Dell Latitude X1 doesn't have an internal fan and runs VERY hot from almost the second you turn it on
This product makes my computer feel temperature-wise as though it's not even on
Also it's so quiet that I can hear the fans running ONLY when it is completely quiet which is rare and it's definitely quieter than the internal fan on my old Dell Inspiron laptop
The cord is a bit long as one reviewer noted and I don't know if I would travel with it because it does seem a bit cheaply made which is why I am now looking for a portable fan because I don't want to break this one but the thing is still working perfectly after over 3 years so I really can't complain
Cheap plastic poorly designed Bottom line After 12 months the cord frayed and it is now nonfunctional garbage I will not buy another Targus cooling pad ever and recommend you avoid this model
Does it what it is made for helps keep my laptop from turning into a stove which it felt dangerously close too
Why?That's all I can ask
This pad has an on/off switch located on the cord which is tiny as extremely easy to break
I have owned TWO TWO
of these pads and BOTH have broken IN THE SAME SPOT
Why put a switch on it?
Why not just unplug the usb cord?
I guess its there to break so that you have to buy a new one
Buyer beware- this one small flaw is a doozieOther than that it worked fine when it wasn't broken
But if you want something that you know will last longer than a week look at something better
I have the one pictured but I got it at walmart for $20
So those worried about it breaking take note of that
I like this cooler because the way they have the fan exhaust coming out of the slit on the back
Opposed to underneath the pad so as long as you keep the back clear your good
The one thing I dont like is that it sucks doesnt blow hot air
So my laptop and the pad are fighting each other for air though I think the pad is winning
I went into the pad to see if i could switch the fans around but there doesnt look to be an easy way
I suppose this could be the reason it breaks due to the constant struggle for air
If it werent for the fans id given this a 5 star
I was using this with my macbook proThis is a horribly designed chill pad
It doesn't raise the laptop up enough to allow any significant air flow to actually make the fans worth the battery consumption which wasn't too bad
The two rubber feet on the top edge that raise your laptop up will melt onto the case and leave black marks
The little dongle switch falls apart constantly and you have to push it back together
And WHY is everyone making chill pads out of PLASTIC???
It's called aluminum
Use itI had this for about 3 months before it stopped working
You cannot set your laptop on your lap while using this it doesn't even come close to covering the bottom of my laptop and the fans are laughably weak
Unfortunately this seems to be the case with most cooling pads
This is fabulous
My eMachines notebook computer used to overheat and shutdown after only 1-2 hours of use
Now it will run all day without overheating
The Chill Pad is also very lightweight & fairly thin so it easily fits in my laptop bag along with my laptop
Would have given the Chill Pad 5 stars but took off a star for the light material which leads one to think it is cheap and won't work
Well pleasant surprise
Prelude - I have totally had it with my Vaio shutting down
I have never had a laptop that heated up to a third-degree burning stage shut down so often and I have tried to be ingenious at inventing my own cooling system
Well after having to rig all kinds of awkward items that only occasionally worked I am thrilled and more than happy with the Chill Pad
When you see it in person you will assume that a anyone could make such an item and b it won't last or even hold a notebook computer on it without crackingBehold
it does a fabulous job the material is much sturdier than at first glance and it is reliable
Even on your lap it's very comfortable light and keeps the computer going
For the first time we we ran a 4 hour video in the DVD drive which in the past would heat everything up and shut down in less than an hour
I was able to complete work without worrying about saving it as often etc
Enough said - don't reinvent the wheel just buy the Targus
This product does what it says well but is a bit cheap
The silver paint on the plastic is starting to rub off but it does keep my laptop really coolPros-small-quiet fans-fans in centerI have a tablet pc and it gets hot in the center-Keeps laptop cool-blows air out the back so you can set it on a bed without blocking airCons-cheap looking silver paint-silver paint rubs off easy-usb cord is somewhat long for what I need it for-On/Off switch on usb cable is unneeded and adds bulk to the cableBottom line-Does what it says and low cost as long as it lasts it is well worth the money to me
If you own a Mac laptop this is a must
Laptop computers generate a lot of heat
If you actually use one on your lap then you know what I mean
Not only does it become uncomfortable it shortens the life of your laptop
I first bought one of these for my wife as a Christmas present for her laptop
It worked so well that I bought another one for my computerIt is amazing how well it works
Not only is it more comfortable to use a laptop on your lap but it really does a great job of keeping the computer cooler
I have not had any problems with my Mac overheating
If you own or are buying a laptop buy this product
It is well worth the price
You do the math
This is my third notebook and first cool pad
This item does the job it's meant to do
I had trouble with my notebook turning off and this thing has helped better my notebook's performance and life
I just got this today and I notice a complete difference
The keyboard is cool and not hot
I'm a writer so a lot of my time is spent typing away
I would definately recomend this product to anyone looking to take care of their notebook
It only cost $25 on Amazon and it does the job it says it does
Yeah it may not fit on the bottom of my notebook like I thought it would but it's not like its that absurd to look at and it's not like my notebook is teetering
Although it may not be aesthetically pleasing to some it's overall value exceeds it's looks
Trust me it didn't look that great in my eye but I'm not happy when my comuter shuts off from overheating
Like I said a $25 purchase to protect a $1500 product makes sense if you can't afford a new computer everytimetime your computer breaks down
I LOVE my Targus Notebook Chill Mat
The silver color blends perfectly with it and it is very lightweight &amp portatble and ultra quiet
Perfect for small notebook owners
I was amazed at how cool it actually keeps my VAIO
When I first got my notebook it was running really hot and my dining table was getting hot too
Now I have a place to put my notebook on to protect my work surfaces and more importantly keep the notebook cool
The Targus Traveler Coolpad PA239U consists of two small and thin plastic not metal slabs - a base and a swiveling platform upon which the notebook computer is placed
The swiveling platform has two rubber dome risers by the back edge that lifts the notebook at a slightly inclined angle and four rubber feet by the front edge to keep the notebook from sliding
The raised positioning gives notebooks with ventilation fans aimed at the bottom somewhat more room to breatheMy experience with the Traveler Coolpad is that it noticeably reduces heat transference from my notebook to my work surfaces
This presumably results from the increased air volume between the notebook and work surface but may also be because the Coolpad acts as a sort of heat shield between the notebook and work surface - kind of like an expensive drink coaster
Thus although the bottom of my notebook seems just as hot as before my desk feels appreciably less like a hot stove top and more like a desk albeit a slightly heated deskProspective buyers should consider their usage habits and environments before deciding on a purchase
Mobile users may find the Traveler Coolpad preferable if only for its small size 1025" x 675" x 075" and portability
Those who work primarily in well air-conditioned and ventilated environments would also do well with a Traveler Coolpad
Users who tend to work primarily in poorly ventilated or stationary environments should consider notebook coolers that make use of forced convection eg
 powered fans like the Asus Notebook Cooler or other technologies eg
 heat pipes like the Nexus TDD-3000
These other notebook coolers may provide superior cooling but are heavier bulkier and less suited for mobile computing - where every inch ounce and watt may matterfor what is essentially a few pieces of plastic the Traveler Coolpad seems expensive
But the price is in line with other notebook cooling products and the Coolpad does have some benefit especially for your furniture
The design of a laptop makes it more vulnerable to heat than a regular system
A simple way to counteract it is with a cooling pad
I use the TARGUS PA248U Tornado Notebook Chill PadIt is a simple solution
The pad plugs into the usb and draws the power to run the fans to cool the system
This is a smart investmentBe wary of the cord it is not strong and having my kids move the system got it broken pretty quickly
Also watch out when putting weight on the laptop when it is not docked it can cause the fans to be hit by the plasticAll in all it's a worthwhile device
Some of the reviews are misplaced here this is not a powered "cooling pad"
No fans no USB no fancy tricks
This is Targus' simplest pad two plastic plates that swivel one with rubber feet to remain stable and solid on your flat surface the other with rubber supports for laptop
The result a space for the bottom of your laptop to "breathe" and tilting your keyboard to a more comfortable ergonomic angle
Oh did I mention that it's manufactured pretty tough?
Very rugged
Very simple to use no instruction manual needed
And what I like best about this more than the ergonomic benefit is that this is so small you'll find room for in it in your laptop bag
Traveler indeed
This economical little tool goes with you even when the adapter doesn't
Trust me
Try it
I bought this because my very old laptop was overheating
It keeps my computer cool and was a great price when I got it
It is a little loud but other than just great
I bought one and it worked for 2 months and then I had to discard it
Would like it to last atleast a year or so
This is the second time that I have ordered this product
The first time it stopped working after about six months
The power cord at the base as others have already mentioned is made very flimsy and shorted out
I gave the credit that even though I am not rough on my electronics maybe it was me so I purchased a second
I figured that I could actually keep the old one just in case as backup and I would have the cord that I could use on either of them
Well that theory went out the window when I received the new one
Be warned that it is not the one in the photo
It is a new "updated" version
So among other changes the cords are not interchangeable
In reviewing the one in the photo it was quiet cooled wonderfully but again the power cord - both the part you plug into the cooler and the on/off switch which fell apart after about 2 weeks were flimsy and did not hold up
This new one they fixed the problem with the on/off switch by adding a button onto the cooler itself but the cord remains flimsy
It does not cool nearly as well as the original
My laptop remains extremely warm when using it unlike the original where my laptop stayed cool to the touch
It is also very noisy - actually would wake my partner when I used it in bed
Notice I said "used" not "use"
Yup
This one has went Kaput too this one lasted about 3 months till it shorted out
But for about another month after that I could jiggle it near the base and it would come back on of course I would have to rigg it to stay in that position or hold it in place myself
But after a month or so that does not even work anymore so here I stay again without a cooler
I am thinking about trying one of the non motorized coolersat least the power cord won't go out
Interestingly enough this product was offered on the HP site when I ordered my new DV9000 laptop
As previous reviews have stated it is indeed made of low grade plastic
I find it puzzling that HP would recommend this item considering the fans line up in no way whatsoever with the laptop's cooling fans
The USB cord is too long and comes with an ON/OFF slide switch which failed quickly
I cut the switch and wired it directly it worked OK for a while
Now the USB plug on the chill pad itself has to be in just the right position to power the fans
A waste of money don't bother
I bought this laptop cool pad for about $1200 US and it has been keeping my laptop cool for 2 years
I run climate models on my laptop processing monsters so I need a way to keep the laptop from melting downThis product is not high quality - if you move the coolpad around a lot the wires will eventually fatigue and break on you
If you have a screwdriver and soldering gun - it should not be a big deal to fix it yourselfProsHas worked for me for two yearsHas kept my laptop reasonably coolConsWiring prone to fatigue and breakage after a while
This product worked very well with my computer
I have a Dell laptop which is over 4 years old now I believe
Understandably the heat sink and fans don't work as well in it as they used to
It was running slower and getting almost hot enough to burn me definately hot enough to make it uncomfortable to use
I picked up this chill pad and it made a big difference
It keeps my laptop completely cool with the two fans and all my progams run a lot faster now
The fans channel the air out the back of the pad so you don't get any heat on you at all
I did have a problem with the power cord
It came apart at the switch so I just took the switch off and spliced the wires together
Was very easy but now it's just on all the time it's plugged in not that I ever turned it off anyways
Otherwise very good product
I had a good feeling this was going to work well for my computer Dell inspiron 1501 because a friend of mine who has the same computer only had good things to say about it
I feel the same over allIt keeps my computer very cool
Sometimes one of the fans will start spinning slower but all it takes to fix that is shutting it on and then off
It isn't completely silent but it is well worth keeping my computer coolI'd recommend it
I purchased this chill pad for our 17" laptop
The product worked well at first but after a couple of months the blades on the fans started to break off until what we are now left with is a plastic portable base
I would not recommend this product to anyone unless you are looking for a cheap temporary replacement to the one you already own
I have a Dell Inspiron 8500 that is now 7 years old and has logged hundreds of thousands of miles so I take care of my stuff
This Chill Pad ASINB0000AKA8Y Targus PA248U Notebook Chill Pad was purchased for my notebook
It did cool pretty well
Laptop speed performance and battery life improved while using the Chill Pad
After just 5 months of use I have just thrown the Chill Pad in the garbage
Just three weeks after I bought it the plastic feet began to fall off
No problem I thought and purchased new plastic nubs to repalce those that had fallen off
Whatever paint is on the unit the plastic bumps will NOT stick to even after using the original adhesive backing which has stuck to my Dell for years contact cement and super glue
No plastic bumps on the bottom -- big discomfort on my legs
Today I noticed that my laptop was hot
I checked the Chill Pad and the fans were not running
Initial troubleshooting pointed to the USB plug not making proper contact so power to the unit was intermittent
Replaced the USB plug
Chill Pad ran for about 30 seconds
Further troubleshooting revealed a broken wire at the flexy joint on the mini-plug that plugs into the Chill Pad
The wire is so thin that I had a heck of a time trying to fix it VERY CHEAPand finally disassembled the unit and wired direct to the fans
Testing my work only one fan was running
I surmised that even though I soldered all connections shrink wrapped everything AND used a grommet at the edge of the Chill Pad case the Targus wire was so thin that something probably pulled loose during reassembly
Rather than waste any more bench time on a unit which had 32 gauge wire in it I threw the whole Chill Pad in the garbage
By the way my Inspiron with a 169 LCD screen overlapped both sides of the Chill Pad by almost an inch
If you are looking for quality and a large enough cooling solution for a 17" laptop look elsewhere than Targus
I bought this cooler at the same time as I bought my Acer Aspire 5600 laptop almost 2 years ago now
It worked well for a few months and then began cutting in and out forcing me to jiggle the connector the USB cable plugged into to keep the fans running
Eventually it stopped completely
I took it apart to see if I could repair the connector but it wasn't possible
I've been using the laptop without a cooler but I'm very careful not to block any vents
So far so good
this chill mat does everything you need it to do
it allows your computer to stay at a safe working temp so you do not have overheating and you wont have to burn your legs anymore when you use this product
I'm re-editing my previous review
Ive had 3 laptop fans and this did better than the other 2 i have had
one being 35 the other being 45$ wont give brands
The main complaint i have is that the cord used to plug the usb into the fan and the computer is very flimsy and breaks easily
It broke after a couple months of use i didnt move the fan if much at all the cord just sat near the side of my desk and was being pushed on a little
I think it's an okay product but i think they should offer a better quality plug in cord
Also i might add it is by far the quietest fan ive had but like i said the cord is cheap and breaks easy
I've bought at least 4 of these and every one has lasted for about 2 months
The only reason I continued to buy them is because I could never find another brand
I finally found some others here on amazon that I will tryI would not recommend these to anyone
They are garbage plain and simple
I bought this item back to complement my new laptop that gets pretty hot when running high end applications and computer games
It worked great but after about 4 weeks the plug that connects to the cooling pad became loose and the fan would only come on if I moved the cord "just right"
A couple weeks later it stopped working for good
I would recommend buying another cooling pad and maybe spending a little extra for a higher quality product
This cooling pad is cheap for a reason - and it makes no sense to have to buy the same thing twice
I am now looking at replacing this chillpad seeing as how it doesn't work at all anymore
I used this product for a few months and then it just completely died
I kept it in good condition and everything but it just stopped working
The Targus PA248U Notebook Chill Pad which I purchased on 17 February 2009 exceeded my expectations
The two large fans were so quiet that Icouldn't hear them yet I could feel the air stream they created
this is cool my laptop was so hot on my legs that i had bruises until i show this TARGUS NOTEBOK CHILL PAD this is the best thing for hot legs easy connection and very lightweight you dont know it is there this is a great product and was delivered to me in 2 days with no problems THANKS AGAIN AMAZON COM
This cooling fan worked for about 6 months before the USB power cable frayed and it developed cracks in the plastic
I wouldn't recommend it if you're going to be messing with the cord much
At first this worked great but three months after I bought it stopped working
The point where the power connector plugs into the Targus stopped transferring power
If I hold the connector at a certain angle and don't let go then it will work
Very disappointing but I guess you get what you pay for
Do not buy from this company that originate from Brooklyn
The cooling pad was delivery 2 days after I order but when it came I immediately wrote for refund and nobody has yet to reply me today is 2nd dayThe pad I bought is used because there are scratchs mark over the cooling pad plus the two plastic cyclinder where the fan is blowing is scrapMoreover to further confirm my suspectious I check the opening gap of the console and find that the dust being accumulate below the fan
This is redicules as new pad would not have any dust on it
Pls beware of this company

It cools by forced air which is the best method
The raised top and channels in the top surface allow for air dissipation and the intake channel in the back supplies air to the fans
Butthe power cord doesn't last
I just went through my 3rd one of these in about 14 months
Unfortunately I've researched for another option and cannot find one that I believe will work effectively
Since my exhaust fan is small a pad that sucks air might cause a vacuum inside the notebook housing resulting in overheating
I think that I'll purchase another one of these locally keep the receipt and return or exchange it when it breaks down
I bought my laptop and decided to buy the chill mat to keep my laptop cool
For some reason it has quit working after only a couple of months
I will not buy another one
Update I bought the chill pad in April it's now November and I'm happy to say that it's still working still doing a great jobI've had this chill pad for about a month
I was concerned about how my 17 inch laptop would work with thisyes it is about an inch or two over each side but with the little rubber grippers pads it stays in place
As to how well it worksgreat
The bottom of my laptop is cool unlike what it was like beforeso far so good
After 1 week the performance seemed to degrade after a month it no longer worked
For that first week it cooled quite nicely though
will adequately cool your laptop however my unit started shorting out after about a year of use
The on/off switch was also faulty
I bought this item not to cool my laptop but to provide some insulation from the heat when it's on my lap sitting in a chair
I'm very satisfied with it's being able to accomplish that
HOWEVER the cord ended up breaking after a few months
Targus replaced it at no charge which is good but still a hassle
Now one of the two fans has started making a racket when I first turn it on
After a bit it settles down but very noisy at first
The unit is smaller than appears in all photos I've seen
My 154" Acer laptop hangs over the Chill Pad in all directions
But the good news is the two up-facing rubber bumps are "grippy" so it hangs onto the laptop and here's the most important part it keeps my laptop COOL period
That is no small feat because this laptop gets pretty warm
This is a cheap model which I had picked up and is still date servicing me just fine
The good part is the on/off switch which comes along with the product
I use it CONSTANTLY to cool by laptop with no issues
BUT The build/construction is really shoddy
I am very surprised at this but the pad is coming apart by it's horizontal seems - altogetherUPDATE UPDATE --> 3 yrs
now running almost continuously for every day +4 hrs
NO PROBLEMS
amazing
I had to clean it once just rip apart the sticker and behind which simple Philips screws
VERY good product
I first bought the Targus laptop coolpad which also works as a stand and it worked good but my laptop a Dell 600m was still running a bit hot on the top
My wrists were getting hot from the laptop so I decided to buy the chill pad
I put it under my friend's laptop first since his is a bigger HP ze5200 15" his always ran cooler than my laptop because of a bigger fan but now it's even cooler
I lifted up his laptop to feel the bottom part and it's nice and cool now whereas before the top would be cool but the bottom would be hotNow my laptop is smaller than his and it's cools it down alot
I cannot imagine not having this product now
My wrists are thanking me
The only thing I can say for Targus to do is to combine both the chill pad and coolpad/stand into one product
I like having my laptop at an angle since it makes typing alot easierIf you run your laptop alot which in my case I am a grad student and it's on alot throughout the day---then get this chillpad believe me you won't regret it
I bought this and have regretted it ever since
The fans are too loud and the cord does not stay in the coolerIt's cheap for a reason
For this to be of vaule a laptop or other device must have an air passage on the bottom
For laptops every model I have seen takes air in on the bottom and exhausts it out the side
This device would help to increase the volume of air in the bottom of the device -- except this device pulls air down rather than pushing it up
Hence this device would cause the effect of starving the laptop of air rather than helping it
Be cautious in your use -- note the device pulls air into the fans
I bought one of these several years ago and liked it so much I bought one for my wife
She uses it all the time
Amazing how cool it keeps my laptop
Definitely recommend this product
My laptop has no difference in temperature than sitting on hardwood
So it's job of cooling my laptop left a lot to be desired but hey it angled it nicely for typing
About a month after I bought it though one of the rubber pads that elevates your computer slid off it was merely glued
I can't imagine what I could have done to prevent this as it never left my desk so I'm going to attribute this to poor craftsmanshipAll in all I love Targus products but this felt like trash you get what you pay for definitely is true here
This is a great product
I bought it on a whim because it was cheap after rebate and absolutely love it
It cools down my MacBook Pro to tolerable levels and is VERY QUIETI also bought an Antec figuring it would be better and more stylish but the Antec is just larger makes more noise even when on the 'low' setting and does not cool down my MacBook pro nearly as muchThe only drawback I can find is the size which is smaller than my laptop but that doesn't bother me too much
I have had this Chill Pad for about 4 days now
It arrived as advertised
It made a huge difference in cooling off my laptop
The Two fans works great and silent
The cord is long but you can tie it and it becomes a great fit
I recommend this product so far If I run into problems I will write back
I purchased this product about a year ago and it has already taken a dive
It worked well when new and kept the computer cool and ran guietly until one day the fans started to make a squeeling sound and out it went
Works like a charm
Silent and efficient
Make sure to turn it off when you close your notebook
Fits nicely in my case and travels well
Wish the cord were shorter
I had an older laptop that was brand new and never used because it kept locking up
The mouse would not move and I would just have to "hard" shut down
Noticed that if I blew on the fan it could get the mouse working again
As soon as I tried this product I have had no problems at all
Compared to my other laptops it stays cool to the touch
So a brand new laptop that I was going to toss is now a perfect 1st computer for my 10 year old son
Great product
This product worked really well until it just stopped working
I had the unit for 45 days and then it ceased to work
I think it is probably a short in the cord but it is cheaply made and I got what I paid for
I should have read the other reviews and noticed that others had had similar problems
I had a problem with my laptop overheating so I picked this up
For the three weeks it worked it worked well no problems with heat whatsoever laptop was completely cool even after many hours of continuous use and the internal fans rarely had to runHowever after about three weeks it just stopped
The problem seems to be the on/off switch or connections to the switch
I would look for a different product with a sturdier constructionUpdate I got a replacement for the one that stopped in the review above and even while being *extremely* careful with it particularly the power cord it still died after just five months
Fans would either run slowly or not at all
Again while the fans actually ran it did a great job of reducing heat but these don't seem to be built to last
This product really helps with the hot Dell 600M I use it with
One thing though
The shipping box was really busted up with hardly any attempt to pack it in the box
Frankly surprised it worked the way the box looked when it got here
I use a laptop since I am always on the go
I noticed that my laptop often gets hot since it is on all the time
I thought that getting this would help reduce the heat and possibly help the performance of my laptop
It works and the quailty of the product seems to be great but it really doesn't do much if anything at all
I think the idea of the cooling pad is great but not effective
I thought this would be a great item but when it arrived I found that it just wasn't what I was looking for
The fan didn't alway work there were no adjustable legs on it and it just didn't live up to my expectations
I returned it for the iCurve laptop stand and am estatic
My computer was overheating even when doing very basic tasks
It was constantly blowing out hot air very hot air
This product changed that and now it only blows out cold air
The only gripe is that it barely fits under my zd8000
When I bought this it didn't run all that well although when the fans did actually work my machine was definitely cooler
However the fans continued to stop for no reason and now the chill pad does not work at all and it is only 2 weeks after my purchase
I would not recommend this product
Although it did cool my laptop the fact that it stopped working after only two weeks makes the purchase waste of money
And it just makes the cycles of heating and cooling worse
Before the max temp was 60deg C and that was a concern
Afterwardsthe temp of the laptop went as high as 80deg C Terrible result
But I lived with it for a few more weeks as taking the laptop off the pad cooled things down
Yes with heavy maintenance it led to lower average temps
But it is much more work than should be necessary
When I first opened the package I was disappointed -- I expected it to look more technical than it did
But when I put my laptop on it for the first time WOW
My computer wasn't overheating so the cooling wasn't the driving factor for me
But it keeps the laptop at a perfect typing angle and the swivel is really useful as I work
I tightened the screw to keep it from moving too easily
It also fits nicely into my laptop backpack
I paid full price for mine at a large retailer so if you can save a few bucks try to
But it is worth every penny I spent on it believe me
i recommend don't buy this product because i waist my money whith that does'nt work and made some noise my laptop not get the cool tempeture than they said
A pair of these were ordered for Christmas presents for my sonsThey said "They really do workhelps the heat problem with their notebooks"
Got this item thru Staples--at a substantially higher price than Amazon
What a waste
This item was DOAIt SHUT DOWN MY LAPTOP INSTANTLY
Dead
Kaput
Gone
The chill pad's fan never worked--AND it shut down EVERYTHING on my laptop--no response at all
Wouldn't even go thru the startup sequence
Once the "kill pad" was unplugged from my laptop the computer returned to life with the help of a complete restore cycle
I could not return it fast enoughDON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE
BAD CHOICE AND A COMPUTING HAZARD
MAY DAMAGE YOUR COMPUTER
I learned this the hard way 
Excellent product except that the Targus Chill Mat has the following warning a warning that is starting to show up on far too many frequently used high contact electronic devices--- This product contains chemicals including lead known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm
Wash hands after handling
---First rationally except for the lead reference which is concerning in itself the warning is far to vague to be useful
What "chemicals" are we talking about?
At what levels?
Where are the chemicals?
Inside out of reach in the casing or in the cord?
Is this a real concern or a California over reaction?
None of this information is available so we get to guess at our risk
That's a game I'm not willing to playSecond outrage this is a product designed and marketed for lap use which means constant handling
To knowingly produce a product from a material that should require such a warning label is irresponsible - especial for a high contact item
It is also ridiculous to expect consumers to a see the fine print on the packaging it should be bold and an eye-catching b remember the warning for the life of the product there is no warning label on the Chill Mat only on the packaging and c be able to washing their hands after handling if you are using it on your lap its impractical to impossible to "wash your hands after handling"
I read the fine print to late the package is open so now I'm looking for a replacement that isn't knowingly toxic to the user And for those who like "made in the USA" labels this is made in China
If not for the disregard for human health the warning implies I would rate this product as five stars no other problems after a few weeks of use and buy others but not now
It does what it was designed to do very well and my other half and I are vary please with its performance
Ours is made of thick sturdy plastic is feather light and has quiet fans - no louder than the laptop's - that saves our legs from the Dell 710m slow broil bottom intake left vent perfect size and even help keep the laptop including the bottom cool to the touch It's not unusual for me to sit with it in my lap for 12 hours at a time
And so far it works well with our new Dell e1505 back intake left vent inch or less overhang all sides
The only thing I'd like to see is one USB pass through so you don't lose a USB slot
To bad it needs a hazard warning
Was taking a Heat Transfer class this semester when I recently bought this 'thing'
Good thing the notebook that I newly gota Toshiba Satellite 5105-S701gets hot pretty fast at the bottom that I wonder that I can boil water with such heat
The coolpad which consists of two plastic parts heightens the laptop by putting four rubber cushions that raises the bottom part of the laptop
This allows air to pass through the most hottest part of any notebook-and the designer must have studies his/her heat transfer well for this utilizes natural convection in a very simple way
Another advantage the top part of the Coolpad swivels so you can swivel your notebook to any direction you wantOverall am satisfied with the purchase although I have to agree the price is somewhat high for such a simple product
I purchased this product and found it to be extremely cheap and flimsy feeling
The right front screw housing broke when pulling the unit from it's packaging
In addition the air flow from the unit is extremely weak
My Mitac laptop has a fan on the bottom for exhaust so I figured with summer my tabs on the PC always get stuck to the counter
This item is very nice indeed for a stable platform
Nice for lifting and having the hot air be directed in a different direction rather then just heat up the underside of the laptop
However this item I am sorry to say does not conform to larger model laptops
It doesnt sit on my lap easy and definatly not when I have my Wireless G card on the side
I would wind up if im not careful busting it
However if you find the place to keep it aside from your lap
Such as your bed floor table This item will be a nice aide and you wont feel cheated for what you paied
However if your looking into keeping your laptop cool for the summer I would suggest the one pad I saw that is PS2 powered and dual fans
Seems abit larger and will cool off same time
Dont have it myself however I may get it
My co-workers ALL had the Targus coolpad
I was jealous and somewhat miffed that they ordered one for it seemed everyone but me
Finally I decided I could not live without one because my laptop seemed to get so warm
HOWEVER the very best part of this product is how perfect it angles my laptop
I had no idea what I was missing
This has made a great difference in ease of use of my laptop which we all know does not have the most friendly keyboard
Seriously this product cannot be beat
Is perfect for all laptops of all sizes
Makes a perfect gift and a definite must-have for any frequent laptop user
great ideapoor buildit lasted 2 months and then died
I've had my latop for less than a year
In that length of time I have gone through two - count 'em two - Targus PA248U Notebook Chill Pads
The first one lasted about 3 months before it was dead-in-the-water
The second one lasted less than a month
They were not continuously on nor were they dropped folded spindled or mutilated
They just stopped working
I will not be repeating this mistake
We purchased 4 of these for our 4 laptops
They come with an on/off switch on the cord and connect directly to the lap top for power from the USB portOut of 4 two stopped working so we sent them to our "electronics junk drawer"
Going through my file cabinet I found the warranties for them which had expired two weeks ago
arghSo I emailed them anyway
They had me check to see if it was the unit itself or the power cord
Using a working power cord I found the two "broken" units do work it was just the cordI now have an email that they are shipping the cords out to me and they should be here in a few days
Can't give them a perfect score because after all I spent most of the last year with them in the drawer because something was brokenMy daughter says her chill mat doesn't keep hers cool enough and it is always shutting off overheating
But that could be another storyIt defintely helps relieve the heat on the lap when sitting on the couch
I started using this product in the beginning of July and less than two months later it broke
I treated it very carefully and held it properly and followed all the directions
While I was using it it did the job but not for long
Cools off my laptop really well
It's a bit short for my HP it's a 15 in
widescreen but it still does the job
If you want a quick "bottom-line" here it is I will not operate my notebook without it
PeriodTwo years ago I LITERALLY melted my laptop chronic overheating had not only melted my power-cord but cracked my motherboard
It was officially kaput
When I bought my newest notebook the first accessory in which I invested was this chill pad
Now here's the amazing part 
I have an Area 51 m5550 and this VERY minor investment has kept it happily running for over one year WITH NOT ONE INSTANCE OF OVERHEATING
As you may know Alienware is infamous for its cooling issues but this little guy has kept my over-sized notebook consistently cool to the touch
How do I know it's working?
A few months ago I disengaged the notebook from the chill pad and forgot to plug it back in  about an hour later I noticed it had become remarkably hot
Upon allowing the angry Alien a cool-down session I reconnected the chill pad and have had no overheating problems sinceDNow I should note that this is my second chill pad
Since my notebook is either always on or in hibernation I cannot be bothered disabling the product
So after a year of constant running and no cleaning one of the fans had a loud "break down"
I consider that pretty amazing under the circumstances
I replaced the ailing chill-pad with the same exact item  and once again I am running cool and happyQuite simply this small item will potentially extend the longevity of your notebook and create a more comfortable work environment no more toasty fingers
Seriously I will not work/play without it
I had been using my Toshiba laptop for about six hours the day the chill pad arrived
Toshibas have a reputation for getting super hot and mine is no exception
The areas on either side of the touch pad get hot enough to make the unit uncomfortable to use
I was at that point when the mailman rang the doorbellI hooked the chill pad up immediately turned it on and opened the rest of my mail
It was not more than _five minutes_ later that I returned to my laptop and was totally shocked
In that short span of time my laptop had gone from needing to be shut down for an hour to cool off to feeling as if it had just been turned on for the day
I'm serious
This thing is awesome
AND my computer runs fasterNow it is a bit more plastic than I expected it to be
I definitely wouldn't want to take it back and forth to work in my bag every single day
I figure if I am at least as careful with it as I am with my laptop already it will not ever become a problem
I have a 19" laptop so trying to position the chill pad is awkward but it's not a problem
It works great and keeps my laptop cool
I also noticed the battery lasts somewhat longer
I can actually place it on my lap without my legs getting hot
If they made a wider one it would be perfect
Got it on salewhat a waster
Really noisy
Ended up turning it off and using it like I did the cheaper version portable cool pad just for the elevation off the table
The cooling unit works great - WHEN IT WORKS
Virtually silent when running
But the USB/power cord sucks big rocks
The switch housing is cheap and unreliable
The power connector not the USB end also cheap and unreliable
Worked for 2 months - NOW DEAD
This product worked perfectly for a few months
It was quiet cooled enough where my laptop's fan's didn't kick in as much as before
It saved my legs from laptop burns but then the fans started getting louder the on/off switch snapped off in the off position so i couldn't use the item any longer
I bought another one and the same things happened with the fans they were quiet for a couple of months and then they started skipping and squeaking
I'm in the market for another laptop cooler
After reading some of the other reviews for this product I was wary of purchasing it
However I bought not one but three
I'm glad I did
So far my family is impressed with how well they work
The chill pad does exactly what it says it will do
There is not enough noise produced by the chill pad for me to notice
In fact the fan on the computer does not have to run as much so my computer is much quieter
Having it powered by usb is very convenient
The best point is that my laptop no longer burns my lap
Good product at a good price
GREAT ITEM POWERED OFF LAPTOP ITS FANS WORK QUIETLY TO KEEP LAPTOP COOL
SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY US YOUR LAP WITHOUT FEAR OF OVERHEATING YOUR COMPUTER
AN INEXPENSIVE SOLUTION TO PREVENTING COSTLY REPAIRS
WISH I'D PURCHASED EARLIER AS I ALREADY FRIED MY CD/DVD DRIVE AND HAD TO REPLACE THEM
GOOD PRODUCT TARGUS
Arrived on time and in excellant condition
It works very well my laptop is much more comfortable to use
As stated in the description the Chill Pad reduces heat on the notebook and thus - potentially - extends the life of the notebookAfter using my notebook with and without the chill pad I can say for sure that it actually works
The notebooks "hot parts" are clearely colder
While like this effect the pad itself is a little small and may not completely cool larger notebooks mine is a 154" wide screenTwo little rubber knobs are supposed to provide a little space between the top of the chilpad and the bottom of the notebook
However if your notebook's rubber feet are in an 'inconvinient' position they can cause the notebook to be wobly on the pad
Taking the knobs out seems to block the airflow and is not recommendedI think this chill pad will fit typical 154" notebooks but may be too small for 17" or larger
This cooling pad Targus PA248U $1499 is unbelievable
Easily the best buy i have made for my computer since i purchased it
I use a 3 1/2 year old power hungry dell that runs very very hot but not anymore
This thing keeps my computer not cooler than cool - ice cold
Would recommend to anyone with a hot laptop
Purchased this item power cord started bugging out within a month
Had to forcefully tape the cord into the back of the unit after it crapped out to even get it to perform marginallyHuge waste of money
The product is fine shipped as promised BUT had to pay additional $319 to Post Office in order to pick up the Item from them
When I paid the shipping as part of my order WHY do I have to pay additional shipping charges?
A good product you have to buy it and what helps you that your laptop is not overheating and so you can last for long
do not hesitate to buy it
I purchase 2 of the Targus ChillPads
They do work and now I feel NO HEAT coming from the bottom of both computers
I highly recommend them for anyone who uses a MacBook or Laptop at home
Purchased the product two days ago and it came in the mail yesterday
I've been using the chill pad since last nightFirst of all like others before me have mentioned the picture of the chill pad online is not representative of what the actual product looks like
The one I received is gray shaped like an hourglass and doesn't look as sturdy
However I have an Inspiron E1505 which is quite heavy but it seems to hold up just fine
As far as the wiring goes it is not made of the strongest material but since I primarily use it on a desk with little movement it works just fine
The most important thing is that the chill pad actually chills my laptop
My only concern is that my laptop fan still works fairly hard even though the bottom only feels slightly warm
That may just be my laptop's problem though
Oh and also the price dropped by 10 bucks the day after I purchased it
What gives?
Targus PA248U Notebook Chill PadI purchased this chill pad for a toshiba laptop was delivered in a timely mannerI installed it cools very well thanks jack wright
I have been through 2 Targus chill mats in the past 6 monthsThe first I returned when the power cord fell apart
I thought it must have been the odd defective one that got through the factory inspection
I was about to learn that perhaps Targus doesn't inspect at all
The NORM is a flimsy power cord on/off switch
Office Max took it back no questions asked and I happily exchanged it for anotherTargus has an odd power cord
It should be a simple piece joining the chill mat to one of your laptop's USB ports
Instead while it does do that Targus also has a nonsensical on/off switch on the cord
It is simple enough without an on/off switch to just detach the chill mat from one end or the other so the switch is unnecessary at best
Worse is the fact that all Targus chill mats have the same problem with the unnecessary switch always wanting to fall apart
If you are lucky you get one that holds together for a few months
That's as good as it getsBecause The silly on/off switch on both Targus mats was always falling apartI would get out pliers and fix the connecting wires - pretty much on a daily basis
A few of the little wires had never been factory stripped at the ends to allow a connection
So before I reconstructed the gizmo I had to make sure there was enough wire to wrap around the posts in the switch
That did improve the situation for a while
Eventually posts snap off or a part of the switch box when falling apart as it did almost daily lands under a piece of furniture goes into the black hole of missing household "widgits" or worse ends up in your pet's mouth
Office Max people told me that my experience was pretty much the norm with the Targus chill mats
The cheaply assembled switch is the reason people return the Targus mats
The store sends them back to Targus for a refundPeople buy the Targus chill mats because they are inexpensive
At first it is so neat to experience your laptop not heating up
Then the mats begin to fall apartnot so good
My chill mat worked once I had rewired it hence the one star -I have to give credit where credit is due
Wellit MOSTLY worked
Every now and again I would have to shake it to get the fans going
Finally one day chill mat #2 made a funny noise and died
By then our local Office Max stocked the Belkin chill mats
What a difference
For $10 more you get a sturdy well designed product which I will review separately
In this day of heightened awareness of our environment it seems so wasteful to toss out a plastic chill mat after a few months of use
So don't spend your money on the Targus
It is the cheapest one out there in every sense of the word and you will no doubt end up spending more than if you had sprung for a better mat to begin with
I've had this for over 6 months and I've had it on every day and it still continues to function
So long as you don't abuse it and leave it in place
I feel that it'll last for a very long time
My laptop definitely feels cooler after I turn this on
This laptop cooling fan was initially bought as a gift for me
It worked pretty well on my 15" laptop in terms of how great it cooled it
However after only week of fair use the USB cable broke the wires got pulled out and would no longer power the unit rendering it useless
I thought perhaps it was just a defective product so instead of paying shipping to have it repaired or a new cable sent I just bought another
The new one lasted two weeks when the USB cable broke in the same fashion as before
I was not rough in handling the product usually I just used it around the house
Threebb weeks I went through two of them
This product works great in terms of cooling but it is not durable
This purchase lasted maybe a month or two and then just suddenly stopped working
The fan blades just stopped moving one day and I couldn't get it to work again
I love the Targus Podium Cool Pad
I have purchased Five 5 of them in the last Three 3 years
Have Two 2 for myself gave one to my wife one to my Daughter and gave one as a present to some friends
They are great to use for presentations because you can truen them instantly so everyone can see your screen
Very easy to connect to your laptop using a USB connection
The dual fans are quiet and keep the heat circulating so the laptop doesn't get hot
Very satisfied at this point
Hopefully it will lastCraig
I've had this for roughly 2 years now and it's worked alright
It's nothing spectacular but it was able to alleviate the heat problems on my Dell Inspiron 1520
However the build quality is garbage the plastic feels cheap and the USB cord is abysmal
I don't know if it's truly proprietary but if it is I know why other companies haven't had a similar design--because it is awfulThe USB cord on the cooler's end is a fairly sharp needle-like plug which has a small hole which connects to a single pin in the cooler
The issue is this pin and the cord are both flimsy and prone to getting stuck
Well mine did not get stuck this time it broke offI've seen the new Targus ones and they seem to be of a better design--hopefully that means Targus learned their lessonI suppose it gets the job done but for the price
I'd keep away from this model
excellent product
i have another one for 5 years
great design
i needed asecond one
Price is right
One of the first things I noticed about this was that the rubber grips didn't grip my laptop very well
It's not uncommon for the laptop to slide around on it if I move it anyAnother problem I've had is some form of "sputtering" that is it runs for a while then randomly turns off for a while and turns back on after another while
I've left my laptop unattended on it to come back and find my laptop very warmIt's not that expensive so I'd rate it as a decent buy and better than nothing but I'd get something else
Got two of these for two brand new laptops just recently purchased - the first about 1 1/2 months ago and the second 2 weeks ago
The first one lasted about a month before the blades started breaking
By then I had already had bought a second one - which I regret
The second one lasted a week before it started emitting horrible horrible grinding sounds and the first fan blade broke off todayMy suggestions spend the extra money on a good laptop cooling bad that'll last at least a year because if you buy cheap crap like this every 1-4 months - that just adds up anyways
light weight nice and thin works well i blew one up by plugging my laptop charger into it by accident wasn't paying attention to which plug i grabbed
be careful

In the beginning the fans were very powerful and effective
Also the concave shape allowed for great air flowIf it simply had a power cord instead of a faulty plug for the power cord I would still be a happy customer today instead of wiggling the cord to get it to workI did buy a worse fan pad though and I have revised my review for that one
I bought Targus cooling pad together with my Dell laptop 
It has always been very noisy but did a fair job on keeping my laptop cool until yesterday when the fan just stopped working 
Very cheap product and a terrible value for the money 
This is a great buy I got this because my laptop kept getting to hot for my tastes
Especially when I was doing large projects that required a lot of processing power
I have a 15" laptop and was kind of worried about the size of this thing its pretty small
But I tried it out and it fits perfect
I was kind of hoping that it'd come with an extra usb port so you wouldn't lose the one you're using but it doesn'tSetup is easy just plug in put it under the laptop and you're finished
It keeps the laptop cool by cooling the underside where all the heat accumulates and now my computer handles a lot better
Its very soft too you can't hear this thing at allI liked this and would definately recommend to those who are having problems with laptop heat
I bought a MacBook Pro which runs pretty hot and needed something to help cool the heat generated from the notebook
I opted to buy this Targus PA248U Notebook Chill Pad at a Northern California Fry's Electronics store since the price seems right and the spec was comparable to other models that costs $10 more without the sales discount offered at the timeAnyway after using it for about 3 months I noticed that the fan noises started to get really loud and annoying
To the point that it is drowning out the sound from DVDs or videos that is playing on the MacBook Pro
The amount of air that the fan circulates is also reduced considerable
Trying to clean the dust built up was a real hassle design does not allow for easy cleaning
Using the compressed air cleaners helps but it does not fix the fact that the fans seem to be spinning off-balance and rubbing against something when turned onBy pure coincidence my roommate also has a Targus PA248U for her laptop and she complains about the same issue after hearing the familiar loud and annoying sound coming from my Chill Pad
Below is the list of pros and cons that we came up with for the productProsFans initially circulates a fair amount of air to help cool down laptopsChill pad is not heavy so it is portableRuns on power from USBConsDesign Quality - poor
Made of cheap plastic that can't support the weight of average size laptops/notebooksNot much clearance underneath the chill pad to draw airDifficult to perform routine cleaning to get rid of built up dustRubber pads on the corners not sufficient enough to prevent scratching the bottom of your laptops with the chill padUnit is light weight but bulky common complaint for almost all products in this categoryProduct lifespan for me is about 8-9 months my roommate gave up on hers after about the sameFan noises can get extremely loud and annoyingUnit has stopped working while plugged in and turned on and caused notebook to overheat and shutdown unexpectedlyCan't easily replace the small component fans even if you take the unit apartWould I recommend or purchase this product again?
Most likely not unless it is priced cheaper as a disposable equipment that you replace regularly
It did a pretty good job of cooling my G4 notebook it prevented the weird mottling I was getting on my leg because of having a blazing hot surface on it all the time I actually use my laptop on my lap my apartment is too tiny to have a desk
It's not that well made though - as other reviewers have noted the rubber cord casing around the red and white wires that actually carry power tends to pop out of the power switch which is integrated into the cord
You can stick it back in but it definitely suggests a flimsy productMine died after about four months of use which seems rather short to me even for the $25 I paid at retail
Full disclosure I did leave it on overnight a few times maybe seven or eight total which I'm sure shortened its life so if you're using one or planning to get one make sure you use that on/off switch
As for me I plan to get a more substantial product
Its hardly been a month and the product ceased to workThe fans aint movingTried to get hold of customer care and it didnt happen either
Works great but the cord started malfunctioning within weeks of purchase
I resorted to blindly pushing and pulling the cord in different directions and twisting the on/off switch
Eventually even that stopped workingLuckily it's not a tough fix if you're experienced in soldering thanks to my brother so the cord now works like new
However I assume most people wouldn't be able to fix it and the pad is pretty much useless without it so that's a huge problem
My brother suggested superglue-ing the edges of the on/off switch to prevent the cord from slipping/getting pulled out of place
Perhaps if you do that when you first get it you won't have a problem with the cord malfunctioning
good product
lightweight easy to use
not recommended as the only product to use if you want to cool your cpu
it does work well if you just want to get the heat off of your lap
I got this chill pad as a gift and was a bit hesitant to keep it since I haven't had much luck with Targus products
However based upon it's size and weight I opted to keep it give it a try and hope for the best
I wish I would have listened to my first instincts
My notebook has an AMD processor so it runs extrememly hot but at first this chill pad worked great
My notebook fan came on rarely and only after being on for consecutive hours
I thought it was great along with how easy it was to carry the chill pad with my notebook in my bag
However after only 4 months the thing just suddenly died on me
I'm so bummedBased upon other reviews it appears I'm far from being the only person to experience this
I'm going to contact Targus for a replacement since it appears they'll replace it for free
I suppose I'll only use it when I have to transport my notebook
For routine use at home though I'm going to purchase a more reliable chill pad regardless of weight and sizeI would not recommend this product to anyone despite the nice size and weight since it broke so quickly

I've had this thing an older very similar model for over 2 years
It began acting up after about 15 and now is completely useless
One fan doesn't work and the other makes a lot of noise in use so as to make it unbearable to do work with it on
Nonetheless I think I will be buying another
I really liked it when it was working and can't have my laptop overheat again lost a hard drive because of thatThis probably works best if you have vents near the middle-center of your laptop as my Compaq does
My friends with vents only on the side noticed very little change in temperature after using one of these
This product provided a drop in my average laptop core temperature of 10-15 degrees Celsius depending on the processing load and the room temperature
Unfortunately overheating had already caused my computer damage before purchasing so I can use it for the same computing load any more the graphics card fried itself so I can't play gamesI would like to see a bigger drop in temp but for a purely external solution working on a laptop with poor cooling it is more than satisfactory
It is quiet and doesn't draw much power although the cord is comically long
I didn't even unravel the cord from the factory supplied twist-tie and it's still more than long enough
While my laptop is certainly much happier with a cooling pad I'm much happier with a different cooling pad
The Targus is cheap for a reason - I've already been through two different cables to connect it to my laptop the wires came disconnected from the on-off switch the point at which the cable connected to the pad quickly became loose and I'd often have to jiggle the cord to get it to stay on and the feet first left marks on my desk and then eventually fell off and got stuck to things
While I'm glad I discovered the world of laptop cooling pads I wish I'd discovered something other than this Targus first
This is a nice cool pad and works very well
It takes the heat out of the laptop and also serves as a buffer between the laptop and the lap
My amd laptop works better since it runs cooler with this chillpad
The only complaint I have is the power socket is weak
Rough handling will pull the power socket out and render the device useless
So be careful if you have toddlers or pets
My computer was in trouble before I got the cooling station but it did seem to help as much as I could tell
This Chill Pad works great
Keeps my P4 notebook nice and cool
My notebook fan which used to run constantly is now silent
Fans on cooler so quiet I often forget to turn it off when I close up my notebook
Excellent item especially for the price
Would definitely recommend
I first got this in December 2005 and it lasted almost exactly a year
I recently bought new one and decided to try the new cord on the old chill pad and it worked
During the few weeks that I didn't use one my laptop was much much hotter
The fans are pretty quiet the little noise that it does make is not annoying
It works very well despite the cord being crappy
Maybe the cord is replaceable I don't know
This item keep your computer from overheating and most of all give you a great support in my case it has the same size of my laptop so it fits in my notebook backpack
I've had my laptop on for the last week without turning it off ONCE and I also had the chill pad on the entire time
It helps so much and is so quiet
I have a 15" laptop which makes the chill pad about 3" smaller than my notebook but it works and fits great I use it every day
The only time I notice a little warmth in my computer is when it gets turned off by mistake
I encourage everyone to buy this model don't let the cheap price throw you it is a quality chill pad you would pay $3000 or more for in best buy or such stores
I looked at several cooling pads for my laptop and went on a whim with this one
Targus makes a good product so that was one plus
I have been using the Targus Traveler CoolPad for about 4 months and it is wonderful
I haven't had any problems with it - it's small enough to take in any laptop bag or case it's durable it's affordable and it lets my computer "breathe" properly without blocking the vents
I recommend this to any student or traveler
I like it
It moves the air out the back pretty fast
Keeps my legs from melting with my HP shooting all the air down
Now I can actually work in longer stretches because I don't have to take time to air out my lap
Doesn't work
Spend your money getting your laptop fan cleaned or replaced - you'll end up doing it anyway
This was a major waste of money
It lasted 20 minutes out of the box
Even if it was just a fluke that I got a defective one I need to note that it did occur
Shoddy craftsmanship
It looks and feels like a toy
Other than the powercord on my previous chill pad coming undone due to wear and tear I've had no other issues with the item
This is a great product
My Grandson uses his notebook continously and this has helped with it not slowing down
Highly recommended
This was a great buy
It makes very little noise while running
I love the convience of being able to plug it in to my computer through USB drive
I am very satisfied with this item
Product worked for about 4 months
The unit was used for probably 10 hours which were not continuous
It no longer works
Unknown if it is the cord or the dual fan motors
Tried the unit on other computers with negative results
No cosmetic damage still looks brand new
When it worked it drew the heat out of the computer
It works very well
I've been using it more than six months
The switch was gone long time ago so that I have to connect the cable again myself
But not a big deal
I don't have any overheating problem with my DELL INSPIRON 600m model
Got noisy a little bit but cannot feel it during the day
I have purchased two of these units and the only minor problem I have had is that the power shuts off
The problem is easily rectified by moving the plug that goes into the pad to a different position
Other then that it works great and was satisfied enough with it that I purchased a second for a relative
I received the Targus Chill Pad for Christmas
I turned it on and in less than 10 seconds I was ready to throw it away It is too loud
I gave it two stars becuase it does keep my notebook cool but the constant humming noise of the fans is more than I expected
Previously I was using something homemade which worked great and no noise I've gone back to using the homemade itemThe Chill Pad isn't large enough for a 17" laptop
Don't waste your money on this
This chill pad is wonderful my laptop keeps cool and is less expensive than other brands
My mom and I have had our Targus's about a year now and they're still very effective in cooling off our Mac laptops but after about 10 months we both noticed that they got a little louder than they had been originally - which still isn't super loud
They're just not as inconspicuous as they once were and we can definitely hear the whir of the fan as it is still cooling the computer thereby extending it's life
I have a Toshiba Satellite a65 series laptop that started shutting down late in the day due to overheating
Running mobmeter and can tell that this pad does keep my laptop much cooler
Stays around 60 degrees C It may not hold up well have not had it long enough but should keep my laptop running longer
Wish i had bought one earlier
I purchased the Chill Pad so I could use my notebook on my lap without getting 3rd degree burns
The Chill Pad with its two fans dropped the CPU temperature by over 10 degrees F The fans are also very quiet
I can barely notice the noise from them
The Chill Pad is a little too small for my 17" Gateway but the size difference does not bother me at all
As in other reviews I noticed that the power cord is much longer than it needs to be
I just used the same twist tie it came packaged in to take up the slack
I rated it 4 stars since I'm not sure how long the all plastic construction will hold up but otherwise I'm very pleased with it
Check some local stores as the Chill Pad seems to be on sale a lot
I picked mine up for $20 at Office Depot
I've owned one of these chill pads for over a year and use it with my notebook a few hours almost every day
It is very quiet has worked reliably without fail and keeps the notebook cool even when I'm doing heavy-duty number crunching for hours
It also keeps *me* nice and cool when I have the notebook on my lap
I'm buying another so I don't have to swap between different notebooks I useThis device is not made for a road warrior
It is relatively cleap and would probably fall apart with some rough usage
But since I don't move it around much it has continued to work well
It worked perfectly for the first month I had it
Then it just stopped working completely
My laptop stays on for about 8 hours a day and so the heat can be pretty intense
It could be that I just need a mat that can stand up to that kind of use and I just wore this one out
If you use your laptop a lot I would suggest getting a higher quality mat that can stand up to a lot of use but if you just need a mat for occasional use then this might be a good item for you
I love this device
It keeps my laptop from overheating and from burning me when I use it on my lap
Very convenient and quiet
I highly recommend it
So I figured I just got a lemon
It happens
But it seems I'm not the only one
I bought this a couple weeks ago to use when I ran a high-graphics program only time my computer runs freaking hot
So it's not like it was running constantly
It was working fine this afternoon and all of a sudden this evening I noticed I was starting to smell something akin to clothes left in the dryer too long and my legs were burning
I fiddled with the connections to no avail
It's dead
The most annoying part is this is the only laptop cooling device in this town so now I have to take this piece of crap back to the store and get another one until a better model arrives in the mail
Sure it's only $ but for $ I'm sure I can find something that oh I don't know works for longer than two weeks?At least the fans were quiet
It cooled my 154 laptop fairly well for the first few months and then out of nowhere starting making this grinding noise from the right fan
I don't understand what could be causing this because I don't ever move the cooler it stays on my desk all the time
I would poke at it and sometimes it would quiet down but nowadays even the gentle poking isn't working
It's LOUD and GRINDING
But again it's a good investment if you need something you'll only use for 5-6 months
Decent price
Customizeble
Saves your notebook from coffee spills
Small fits in your back pack and cools off your laptop
Most of all it angles the laptop keyboard towards you so that you can tyoe then it also lifts the laptop lcd up 2-3 inches so that you don't have to look down all the times for the price of $2900 or less is a must
I have 6 of these not all for me of course 2 for me and 4 for each of my collegues
The Targus PA241U Podium Coolpad keeps the bottom of the laptop elevated and prevents overheating of the laptop
Great job
This is a very quiet and effective laptop cooler while it lasts
I'm on my third and last one it's the only one I could find in my area
None of them have made it past the 5 month mark
What a difference it makes having a fan under your laptop
I can't imagine I am particularly rough on the fan and laptop however after three months the wiring just sort of came out of the fanI miss the fan and will be buying another one
Think I will do a bit more research before buying the next one
Loving this itemit's saving me from having to replace the existing fan on my laptop - I'm not quite ready to replace my laptop but it's to the point where I don't want to sink money into fixing it up so this was the perfect solution - my laptop doesn't overheat and I'll be able to use it with any future laptops too so it won't be a wasted expense when I eventually upgrade to a new laptop
We were initially skeptical if this would work with a 154 inch Dell Inspiron 8500
My Dell would get heated up very fast in just 1 hour of use and the fan would kick in at high gear
But this chillpad keeps the bottom surface cool
Now we are able to use the laptop for hours without any problemSo far we are happy after about a week of use
small investment on a costly laptopits worth it
my compaq used to get so hot after 5-7 hrs of use that it was untouchable at bottom
this product keeps it cool
Let me say for $10 AR this is a worthwhile investment
I have a 154 inch widescreen laptop and it always got hot on my lap
Now my laptop and my lap stays cool and I have peace of mind
This cooler will not fit a widescreen laptop exactly but good enough
The fan runs extremely silently you won't even know it's on
Buy this product
I have this pad and the larger Podium CoolPad ASIN B000117DEE
I use the Podium CoolPad for my 14-inch iBook when it's on my desk at home
It's larger and height/angle adjustable
I keep this smaller CoolPad in my case for travel
It fits my older 12-inch iBook better than the 14-inch but still quite useable
I use it on my lap for my 121" notebook that heats up pretty quick
It saves my lap from getting burned
I also use it on my desk for the fact that it swivels
I love that because I can easily get to the back to the notebook for plugging things in and out
I couldn't imagine not having one
However it loses 1 star for the fact that 2 pieces of plastic with rubber pads costs as much as it does
I like my CoolPad very much
It does minimal cooling for the laptop but it REALLY keeps my lap cool
New laptops just get too hot to leave and work on your lap
With this product I can leave it on my lap all day with no problem
Also the ability to rotate it in a meeting is very helpful
$20 MSRP is steep but you can find it anywhere from $10-$15 and that's reasonable
THIS FAN WORKS OK BUT EASILY TO BROKE
I BOUGHT THE WIRE FOR SECOND TIME
I USED IT ONLY A MONTH
IF YOU HAVE OTHER CHOICES GO FOR THE OTHERS
THIS FAN IS NOT GOOD AT ALLYOU WILL WASTE YOUR MONEY
This is great if you have a small-sized laptop but the dimensions are rather small
It would not fit my Compaq Presario 2800 too small
Also there are other Notebook coolers that have more than 2 fans I have found up to 4 fans
Though these other coolers are thicker they seem to cool down the laptop much better and are significantly cheaper
Cheers
I use this fan for my Mac because it tends to run pretty hot my husband even had a battery semi-explode so I try to keep mine on a fan whenever I use it
This fan is surprisingly quiet and feels really sturdy
It fits great under my 15" laptop and under my husbands 17" as well
The newer version of this has a great new design
The price on Amazon is much cheaper than I saw in several online and regular stores when I was shopping around
All around great buy
Expect this item to last about 5 or six months with rigorous use
I have had 3 1 died in a couple months one lasted about 5 months and the third is still running after about 9 months but I bought a backup because its going to die soon
There is something with the fan location that usually causes the pad to make noise after a few months making it unuseable
At list price it is expensiveI see it is now ten bucks and at that price buy a few and you'll have ONE good cooling pad
It works well the picture made it look bigger and it made it look like it had a flip up bottom to raise the rear of the laptop BUT it does work well and keeps the laptop cooler for longer
And as long as you are on a hard surface and not using it on your lap it works well
The Targus PA241U Podium Coolpad for laptop / notebook computers is best used only for a single location
Its multiple "Lego" type parts for adjusting its tilt angle can come apart quite easily and be lost if it is used as a portable device
Losing only a few of the stackable pieces can make the coolpad unusable as designed
The oginial Targus Coolpad has only one pre-set tilt angle but is far more user friendly especially as a portable unit which is pretty much the purpose of a laptop / notebook computer
Targus should start making the original model once again
I bought this product on August 6 2007 and today Oct 16 2007 it stopped working
I have a Compaq Presario laptop and when I first purchased this item it worked great and then this morning I turned on the laptop and the Chill Pad did not turn on the fans all of sudden stopped working
I've used the Podium CoolPad for several years now and love it
The three things I like best are1 - The space under the laptop really helps keep everything cooler2 - It slides nicely into the bag with the laptop requiring very little space and3 - It does not require power that drains the battery and adds to the heat problemThe only reason I did not give the Podium CoolPad 5 stars is that I wish it were a couple of inches wider
I like using it on my lap to help keep both the laptop and myself cooler and those extra two inches would add to the stability
The power cord fatigued into uselessness quickly
Slipping the pad in and out of my backpack caused me to lose the rubber footies in short order
Even when the footies were there it didn't cool that well unless I overvolted the fans to 10 V Look elsewhere
It didn't work as I thought it would
The laptop didnt get hot as fast but it was still quite hot
After about two weeks the fan stopped working for some reason
I've been using this Targus PA248U Notebook Chill Pad for about 3 weeks now
I have to say it has made a big difference on my IBM ThinkPad T40
It used to get so hot that I worried about it locking up some day
Also the battery life was getting shorter everyday
Now it seems that I'm getting a lot better life and I don't worry about the hard drive getting hot and failing
Wish I had this when I got the lap top originally
To that note I purchased two more chill pads for my kid's laptops which I just purchased in the last month
They are in college so their HP Notebooks get plenty of use
Hope the chill pad works as well for them
I would recommend this product
Great for the price
This product really helps keep my computer from overheating which was a serious problem
I'd reccomend this to anyone who uses their laptop often
I bought this pad about a year ago and it does a great job at cooling down my VERY hot laptop
The only problem is that the on/off switch literally broke off about a month after I got it
I had to cut the wires reconnect them manually and tape them together with electrical tape to get the thing to work
Even though the on/off swith might've been handy it would've been more durable had they left that item out and just let you unplug it from the computer when you didn't need it
I like it though that it draws the power from the laptop and doesn't need any external power source
If they could just create a more sturdy cord I would give this five stars
I was skeptical at first but willing to try anything to help keep my Apple iBook cool
The tornado chillpad does the trick and is absolutely silent
Especially while playing games a laptop can get really hot with all the processing it needs to go to keep you fragging punks
I was impressed with this product and would recommend it
i bought this for my sony vaio pcg-frv25 this laptop is big and yet i found the chill pad really useful
My laptop used to be burning-hot and now it is not even close to warm
Just a little smaller than my laptop so not as good lookingbut overall greatRecommend
The second one I received was different from the first one and the picture but the small size will be great for taking my computer with me
Targus AWE23US Stow-N-Go Chill Mat for Laptops up to 156 Inches BlackThis is what I got instead of the one I ordered but it is fine with me
Add the right size laptop and this system will keep it cool
If you want more than that you should look elsewhere
I liked this for the price
I had the previous version of this which lasted a few years while constantly running
This version comes with a cheaply made wire which has already broken
I have to prop a book on it to keep it lined up just right so that the fans spin
I will not buy another one unless they use the old better wire
This was too small for my 17 inch laptop?
Laptop wobbles when I keep it on it
Also there are no guides to keep it in place
I think something was subsituted but the wife loves having a second one to leave in her office as well as having one at home
IT DOES WHAT IT IS SUPPOSE TO DO
NO PROBLEM  I RECEIVED IT IN RECORD TIME
LOVE IT AWSOME
Get what you pay for
They become noisy every couple of years but fit my notebook stand perfectly
Bought two
This chill pad was terrible
If I could give it a lower rating I would
I bought two of them four months ago one for myself one for my husband
Already the rubber feet have fallen off the power switch broke off on the day we received them thankfully in the on position and now one of them has completely burned outI've bought other Targus products but this one has been a terrible disappointmentDon't wste your money on this product opt for something a little sturdier instead
Ok this product works well it takes some positioning to work which is why in my opinion it is a 4 of 5 but once its in the right position it works well so if you need something like this i recommend this product
good product that does exactly what it was intended tono complaints
I recently purchased a MacBook and they are notorious for overheating
Once I purchased one of these it solved my overheating issues
The bottom of my book is pleasantly warm instead of blazing hot
I bought this for my Dell Latitude D510 which I use several hours a day
The Targus Chill Pad looks nice but it's not as useful as I hoped
F1
As another reviewer noted the power cord often comes out of the plug & I have to check the fans several times to make sure they are still working2
The fans while quiet are not very powerful
I think one with a higher RPM will be more helpful3
The cooler is about an inch too small all around for my laptop
This doesn't bother me very much but for those of you with larger laptops the Targus will be much too small4
Finally even when the fans are working full time the wristpad is still very warm to the touch even after only using the laptop for 10 minutes
This is my first notebook cooler & I plan to return it & try a different brand
I bought a Targus chill mat a little over a year ago and it worked perfectly up until recently
It still turns on and cools down my HP 154" laptop but the fans make so much noise that it's incredibly irritating
It makes it difficult to have a a conversation or watch tv/listen to the radio
The warranty is only for a yearoh well
i bought this several months ago because i was one of the people who stuck things under the laptop to allow more circulation
it worked great for the first week and then i noticed that it doesn't stay plugged in
so half the time it isn't on anyway when i move my computer the cord moves and if its not in an exact spot the fans dont runsure its great if you dont mind taping it but i recommended getting a different chill mat
Easy to install one cord for power
Works as advertised
What more is there?
I bought this fan after a recommendation from a friend whom also used it
I must admit when i bought this fan it did work good at keeping my laptop cooler
Using the built-in temperature gauge the fan was keeping my laptop about 5 degrees cooler than normal
My friend whom also had this said that games and applications ran much more smoothly while using this fanThe only problem with the fan is that it begins to wear down overtime and when it does it can go down hard
My friend and I both have experienced multiple problems with it over time about a year
These include the following- The power USB cord can have the on/off switch come apart although its rare- The unit itself split in half after use by my friend starting by splitting around the power plug and eventually spreading through- Both of us experienced the fan creating a VERY loud whirring sound as if the fan was spinning much too fast
The only way to stop it was to turn it on and off repeatedly and hope for the best or touch the specific fan right fan in my case left fan was ok and hope the sound stopsThis is a good fan overall but don't expect it to hold up necessarily over time
While my fan is still usable the loud whirring sound happens close to everytime now making me prefer to not use it at all
I bought this because of my Alienware laptop's video card going over 100 degrees celsius
Now not to ding Alienware it's not their fault you can only fit so much hardware in a small space but it overheated fairly regularly
I admit that it overheated when I was playing graphic intesive games that take up a lot of processing power
I bought this with the hope that it would work to keep my laptop cooler and keep it from overheatingBottom line This pad is horribleIt seemed to work fine in the first place considering that it's made of plastic but after awhile the fact that it's meant for a computer that you wouldn't even HAVE an overheating problem on makes this a complete waste of money
The pad is intended for computers of a size SMALLER than the pad ones that you wouldn't even need it for seeing as you couldn't run anything that would use up much power
Then to make matters worse the rubber pads on the bottom of the pad make marks on tables and such making sure that it leaves some indication that it was thereAnd the final straw was that the fans started making noise and practically stop working
The right fan now makes a grinding noise despite not having anything that it could grind into and will occasionally stop spinning
The noise is not only annoying but very very loud so that you can't take it anywhereI would thouroughly recommend getting a product that is NOT from Targus
This review is just a warning to buyers
I bought this item at Best Buy about 2 days ago and already this cooling pad is broken and I'm going to return it
It will work but I would have to hold in the power cord very tightly to keep it powered
There's a reason why Amazon has such a "good" price for this pad
I paid 30 at Best Buy knowing that Targus usually makes quality products but this is there one downfall
I've had the cooling pad for a little over two years for use with a Dell Inspiron E1505
It seemed to do a sufficient job at keeping my computer cool consistently
The unit and laptop would be a little bit awkward to carry together along with the cord which I did out of laziness so I wouldn't have to reconnect the cooling padThe unit stopped working consistently about a month ago
The fans would still turn on when there was no computer on top but would usually stop once I added back the laptop
now i can type at the bed without burning itit works very well i love that it spins and now less tangeled wiresi find it works best on the lowest tilt especially if you are on for long periods of time just be careful it can slip if you dont have iton straight mine never came lose or fell but when moving it from table to bed just becarefulgreat purchase i do reccommend
this item worked great for about a week
It was quit and kept my computer at a perfect temperature
Then after a weeks use it kicked the bucket please do not waste your money on this product
Great item
Unlike other chill pads this one sucks the heat from under the laptop which cools it much better
Downside of this product is that the replacement part of the USB seems to be discontinued
Take good care of the chill pad's USB cord becaise it seems a little fragile if you accidentally tug the cord
Overall great item and I would recommend this since it seems to be one of a kind
It did a fine job while it lasted but wore out after about nine months of light use
This is my second purchase of a Targus notebook chill pad both stopped working after a few weeks
This Targus PA248U Notebook Chill Pad worked well providing adequate cooling airflow for my laptop for about a year after which the power cord receptacle on the unit developed a fault probably a solder joint broke inside from the pressure of inserting the power plug
After that the operation became intermittent and shortly afterwards it crapped out completely
I took the unit apart and found it fairly well constructed considering the plastic components but could not repair the faulty receptacle
As there's no easy way to recycle the two 5 VDC small fans the unit becomes trash
It's a shame because but for this design flaw it's a very effective unit for $20
I recently received this product as a gift
I was showing my father and he fell in love with it
So I got him it for fathers day
I love it
It keeps my laptop computer nice and cool and provides a nice stable surface to put in on too
I recommend this product
I purchased this Chill pad in December
It lasted 13 months and that was with being run about three hours per day
The warranty states it is good for one year so I guess I should be thankful it lasted one month beyond that
However during that time it did work well
The two fans kept my laptop cool and I didn't even mind giving up a USB port to power it
The cord is fairly short and did not get in the way of operating the laptop
It would be helpful if this item was able to tilt the laptop toward you but the newer ones now do that
I was disappointed in the cheap plastic housing but this does help it be quite lightweight
My suggestion is this if you are looking for an inexpensive chill pad that is lightweight and won't drain your battery but may only last a short limited time this is the one to get
If you want higher end materials longer warrenty and more options such as all-over cooling try the Antec
I received this as a Christmas present
I was disappointed to find out it was a Targus brand cooling pad as I had issues with Targus before
The construction on this seemed very flimsy and fragile but I needed a cooling pad
I decided to use it and remained optimistic about its performanceI started using it immediately so let's say December 26th 2007
As of February 25th 2008 it is no longer working
The USB cable connecting the pad to the computer seems to have fried somehow so that the pad is no longer getting power
This is two months of average use on a desk or sometimes my lap with uptimes of a day or twoFor the time it DID work it worked well
My laptop ran much cooler than normal and it gave my fan a much needed rest
If Targus would invest a more durable parts for it it would be perfect
Perhaps they sell replacement cables that are of a better quality than the one that comes in the box
But if you're looking for a *good* chill pad that you won't have to fuss about I would definitely recommend springing for something a bit more high-end
I was looking for a replacement for my Targus chill pad which had fans that just stopped working after 3 years
I was not sure if I should buy this one because of some of the negative reviews
I did not want a flimsy pad that will not cool my laptop
To my delight this pad cooled better than my previous targus and it is sturdy enough for my use
I don't carry mine around it pretty much stays in one place
It is cheap and works great
Great bargain
I bought this product 1 year ago
It works great for 1 month after that the fans stop working
The solution was simple cut off the switch its not necessary if you plug it into a UBS port its bucause you need to fan you computerAfter this simple operation its working again
I think it worth the money that you pay
An essential item to keep your laptop running cool while traveling
The podium coolpad is a better choice for home or office use since it tips the laptop up a little more and allows for better air curculation but also is bigger and doesn't fit as well in a laptop case
I bought this to cool my 12" PowerBook
The pad itself works well -- the weak link is the power cord
The first one had a bad connection in the plug end
After repairing it with some home soldering and electrical tape to cover the wires it worked well enough to wait for the replacement cord from Targus
yes I had to scrape away the housing to find the wires
Within two weeks the wires into the on/off switch were falling out of the switch
This cooler stopped working 2 months after I got it
I think it shorted out in the cord but whatever the problem it still doesnt work
I would not reccomend this chill pad to anyone
I love my new chill pad
My Dell laptop gets extremely hot during use but the Chill Pad completely cools the laptop
I've had this item for a while now and it works great
It is quiet and it keeps my laptop cool
I actually just bought another one as a gift worth every penny
This product is fantastic
I'm sure it will extend the life of my laptop
I encourage anyone with a laptop to purchase this chill pad
The Targus Chill Pad is simple and does what it is supposed to do keep the laptop cool effectively all for an excellent price
The Chill Pad is highly recommended to keep the laptop battery from overheating which will undoubtedly extend the lifetime of the computer
Good product
Fans definitely keep bottom of computer cooler
This is my second Chillpad
The first lasted 5 months w/ heavy use
light small works great for my laptop
i totally recommend it if you have a small laptop im sure it'll work just fine with bigger laptops
i love the fact that it's usb-powered
the chill pad works really well if you have one of those laptops that overheat like most dells
however i'm not sure about how long they last b/c my last chill pad started making weird sounds b/c hair somehow got caught in the fan and i couldnt take apart the chill pad to take the hair out
other than that the chill pad does what its supposed to do
This is a great idea and the price is right
However it is not well designed
The on/off switch is on the USB power cable and is very easily broken
I think placing the switch on the side of the device itself or at least making one that is more sturdy would improve this product immensely
i love this thing
it works great for my laptop and very useful you really can turn it 360 degrees
We have been very pleased with the Targus Notebook Chill Pad
We use our Dell laptop 15" screen quite a bit while sitting on a couch and have been plagued by the heat it creates in our lap for several years
With this cooler we have resolved the heat issue entirely
It makes essentially no noise and since it plugs into a USB port for power it is so easy to use
We would recommend this product to anyone who wants to stop feeling the heat from their laptop computer
This DOES make a difference but I found myself wishing that it worked better than it does
On the positive side it is lightweight although I see what some reviewers mean by the cheap feel and the fans are relatively quiet
However it doesn't move nearly as much air as I wish it did which is probably the tradeoff for the quiet fans
When all is said and done while it helps my laptop still runs pretty hot when using taxing applications
Just a so-so product for me
This is one of the best purcahses for my laptop I have made thus far
I run my laptop as a game server so it's on day and night
I chose a laptop because of the battery it holds I have it connected to a timer that disconnects it from the wall every X number of hours for 1 hourBecause of the way I run my laptop it was starting to get very hot and I was afraid it would over heat and fail
At times the laptop keyboard was *hot* to the touch
This pad cooled the laptop down so much
The fan is so quite tooIf I had any complaint about this it would be the length and width but I don't even want to complain
My laptop is a widescreen and the size of the cool pad is not affecting it's function
For what I am doing this is exactly what I needed
Great product
Keeps machine MUCH cooler
It has prevented my laptop from over-heating and shutting offIt is a bit loud but I'm not sure there is much which can be done about this
I bought this product about 6 months ago and I was very happy with it until recently when it decided to just stop working
I personally don't like buying things that I'm just going to have to replace again in a few months so I would recommend going with another brand
This review is for the PODIUM Coolpad which has NO FANS  Oddly there are reviews for the Chillpad which does have fans mixed in hereThis is a simple product that does two simple things that gives you three benefits
It lifts the back of your laptop up off of the surface it's sitting on to a variable selected by you height
This allows better airflow under the laptop which is often all that's needed to allow the laptop to run acceptably cool
This also puts the keyboard at a slant which for some like me is more comfortable for typing
The other thing it does is swivelIt's all very basic and simple which brings some other benefits
There's not much too it so it doesn't take up a lot of space in your laptop bag and the weight is minimal
Being simple there's not much to go wrong and mine has lasted for years now supporting it's third laptopI now use this with a very large very heavy Toshiba Qosmio and it's still holding up fine
The Podium comes with a support bar for large laptops that's very helpful
I did not purchase this from Amazon I purchased it from OfficeMax I think?
Anyway I got my first laptop 4 years ago and this is the cooler I bought to go with my laptop at the time
To this day I am still using the same Targus laptop cooler it hasn't let me down
I have waited for it to crap out simply because my laptop is on nearly all day and all night but nope it keeps going
At the time I purchased this I think I paid around $25 or so for it
I would have to say that I have got my moneys worth and then some
Sometimes I do unplug it so that I can use the USB port real quick and I can surely tell a difference on how hot my laptop gets when I have it unplugged
Once I get done with the USB port I plug it back in and my laptop gets cool again-perfect
I have the Targus Podium CoolPad with 360 Degree Rotation
This product does NOT plug into anything
It's a silly piece of plastic that elevates the laptop back allowing airflow underneath
It breaks down into something about the size of a notebook and a giant roll of spree candies and gets stuffed into my travel bag
It's easy to use it's small and light and it takes up no energy from my laptop which I've read causes the laptop to heat up even more
I highly recommend this product or if you feel industrious go build something similar yourself as a great option to cooling your laptop
Ignore the 360-degree rotation option because the lap top gets a little wobbly when you rotate the base
I've had my Coolpad for over 4 years and love it
It is simple and I would have given it 5 stars if there was a bit more thought in the design
But it is simple reliable and compact
This is a great low-tech and efficient accessory for a laptop
I have had one for several years & as I move from notebook to notebook it follows along very well
Simple - no fans or batteries - it raises the laptop slightly to allow the vents to cool more efficiently
It's also great as a means to swivel the notebook around in place without actually picking it up or otherwise moving it
This was a great buy years ago & I intend to buy another one for my husband's new laptop
The rubber pads on the bottom help keep the notebook in place when swiveling or just typing & I would not use the laptop for any length of time without having this baby in place
Worked for all of a month
Fans began making noise almost immediately after purchase
Then one of the fans stopped working
Save your money and don't buy this item
I finally threw the thing away and bought an Antec coolerafter 7 months it still works great
After using this product it is very difficult for me to type on a laptop that is flat on a surface
This podium puts the keys right where they are comfortable to use and it is your choice where that would be
It gives room between the counter and laptop for breathing space
I highly recommend this product
Easy to use nothing to plug in rotates nicely and cleans up quickly when needed
Also so easy to stick in your bag with your laptop and take along anywhere
I already own one Podium Coolpad and ordered a second for my new laptop
It's a great little product that serves two purposes--it keeps the laptop off the desk and so facilitates cooling and if you are using it as a desktop replacement as I do with both my laptops it raises the screen a few inches giving you a more comfortable view
I use a wireless external keyboard and mouse and the Coolpad makes my setup perfect
Highly recommended
this cooling pad is amazing
I bought one for myself 3 years ago and it still works great
just recently bought one for my brotherhowever this cooling pad is mainly good for laptops with the hard dives in the middle
If your laptop hard drive is on the side then this cooling pad isn't exactly what you may want to invest in
I have gone through three of these coolers
All with the same issues
Either the wire stopped working or one of the fans
It is made very cheaply and isnt meant to last long
It does keep your laptop cool but its durability and reliability are very poor
Go with the antec laptop cooler excellent unit that has worked great for me for over a year
The antec is built much more durably than the targus so go with that one
I picked this model out because of all the good reviews and for the most part they're true
The unit does a decent job of cooling my 15" powerbook
I grabbed a Chill Pad why does typing that make me think of a House Party movie?
for my girlfriend's 15" VAIO but it still runs a bit warm but then the Pentum in there runs much hotter than my G4 so maybe the Chill Pad just can't keep up
Either way I wish the units were a little wider
In a perfect world I wish the fans weren't placed in the middle of the slab but more towards the back where a laptop's CPU & video chips are located
This thing is plastic so it won't dissapate the heat as well as an aluminum one willOriginally I rated this puppy 4 stars
I'm taking it down to 3 now because after some typical use over the past 6 months both of our Chill Pads are pretty thrashed
The power cord on my girlfriend's unit is falling apart mostly around the power switch box thingie to use the technical term
As for mine the screws holding the back together have cracked their casings which were rattling around in my pad until I shook them out yesterday
So the back end of the unit no longer has a flush seam
Maybe some Krazy Glue will do the trickI didn't drop kick this thing around pretty standard use brought it to the office almost daily
Used it at home as well
Took it overseas once
I'll give it 4 stars for cooling but I'm taking 1 away for workmanship
I have owned many a laptop and several notebook cooling pads
Cooling can potentially improve a computer's performance and useful lifeThis pad has decent performance
But it is made from cheap plastic and has design short-comings
The product pictures and price make you think it is made from high grade plastic or metal
I feel for anybody who ever paid the list price of $30 for this productReading the reviews for this product I realized that several key elements of this product's construction were not being mentionedPros- The fans do seem to push a decent amount of air more than other pads- The rubber risers allow for better air-flow under your laptopCons- This product is made from low grade plastic
It is flimsy under the weight of any standard laptop- The rubber risers which seperate this product from your laptop will come out They are not glued in- The rubber feet on this pad will also come out- The fans inside can be very loud- The 2 fan heads are poorly positioned in the center of the pad- The usb cable is too longFor the price there are simply better alternatives
The Antec notebook cooler has a more durable aluminum top ergonomic shape and more quiet design
The USB connector also has an extra portAntec USB-Powered Notebook CoolerAs long as you don't mind the defects this can be a handy unit for a spare or travel needs
This cooler is still worth owning if you can buy it on sale for $11 or less
Don't pay moreHappy Shopping
After spending four months trying to get Dell's tech support people to simply acknowledge that the Inspiron 600m has a problem with overheating while playing hi-end 3-D graphics games I took a gamble and bought the Targus PA248U Tornado Notebook Chill Pad
At first it only helped to delay the problem -- the computer still overheated while playing games like "Warcraft III" or "Rise of Nations"
The cooling fans on the chill pad were doing a good job of cooling the center of the notebook but the back was still getting hot
I tried lifting the back on the notebook by setting the backend of the notebook on two hi-lighters to lift it about 1/2 inch above the chill pad to improve the airflow and that solved my problemMy notebook is a Dell Inspiron 600m with the following configurationPentium M 725 16GHz 2MB level 2 cache512MB DDR SDRAM 1 DimmATI MOBILITY RADEON 9000 w/ 64MBWhen playing 3-D graphics games the computer especially the memory chip would get very hot and the frame rate while playing the games would drop 95% in one game dropping from 60fps to 1-3fps
The computer never crashed but it made game playing impossible
The Inspiron 600m is a thin notebook 129" thick so it probably doesn't allow enough airflow to adequately cool off the components when pushed to their limit by a 3-D graphics game
Thank heavens companies like Targus are making products to address this issueJust as a note to Dell users I talked to about a dozen different Dell tech support people over a four month period and no one would even admit to having heard about this problem
Apparently Dell has a policy of never admitting that a problem exists
Cut to the chase and skip all the rest- A lovely multitasking convience productI have a 15 macbook pro and my lap was taking a lot of heat
Not to mention the funny angels you can get yourself into while reclining on your porch can be at best awkward for tying
The Coolpad has these simple lego style pieces that you build onto on another to raise your laptop in 1/2 inch increments up to 1 3/4 inches
If you build fewer than 4 posts you can build it much higher but have fewer contacts touching you laptop It seemed a bit silly all these lego pieces floating about but after using them I love it
It's so easy to adjust so when you are at a table vs when you are lying on your belly you can have the height you desire
I hinted at it but let me say it clear- Yes the Coolpad lets you use your laptop on a bedOne last bonus for those of you living with children or someone prone to spilling drinks- your $$$$ piece of equipment is raisied off the surface it's on
That in itself is worth it to meThe turntable feature is aslo a win
I was afraid it would lull about freely but you have to exert a little just enough to turn it
I didn't think I need this ability at first but find everytime I want to show someone my screen I intuitvly use it
Whenever I begin to take this feature for granted I see someone else picking up their laptop to turn it and as they jarringly set their laptop down I cringe and appreciate my Coolpad for the nice piece of hard drive protection it isAs for the airflow cooling aspect well I beat my mac with high processor programs and yes the fan still kicks on but I feel better knowing it has an easier time cooling off
There is no worry about the fans being blocked or struggling for air so to speakSo* all ports are free* laptop is at your desired typing angle* you can turn your laptop about 360* guaranteed an air buffer no matter where you set down* liquid spill protection* non slip rubber feet really hold laptop in place I mean secure
I looked at every kind of portable stand for a week and finally wearily bought the Coolpad
I would buy it again in an instant and will purchase several at Christmas time for all those I know who have admired lusted and "borrowed" my Coolpad
It seems the portable lap desk and chill pad reviews are being mixed together -- this review refers to the chill pad
This chill pad seemed great at first it fit nicely under my 12" display laptop may not be adequate for very large notebooks ran quietly and kept the otherwise blazing-hot notebook running
I did use it constantly but only around the house so it sustained no additional wear from being carried around
Problem is the thing only lasted 8-9 months with full funtionality for only half of that
Fan power drastically decreased over time with one fan hardly spinning at all by the end
The construction quality is just not very highBottom line there are MUCH better notebook coolers available and you'll earn back the extra money when they don't fall apart
I recommend the Antec cooler I replaced this with -- unlike the chill pad it features a metal surface to conduct heat removable plug-through USB cord cord storage on back of unit two fan speeds automatic shut-down when the computer is off and moves so much air you might get chilly yourself just holding it
I know I sound like a salesperson but I'm just so happy with the Antec over this Targus product that I want to save others the wasted time and effort in trying it
I bought the Coolpad after reading the positive reviews here on Amazoncom but am quite disappointed
My Fujitsu has vents both at the bottom and in the rear so it doesn't overheat but can get quite hot when I edit digital videos a CPU- and hard drive-intense task
I bought the Coolpad hoping it would help cool down the laptop so the laptop's internal fan wouldn't have to work too hardTo my disappointment there does not seem to be any cooling improvement whatsoever
If your laptop has vents only at the bottom and has no rubber feet then this may help
Again it's a strong "may" or "might" as in "perhaps" as acknowledged on the packaging
I suspect the Coolpad doesn't elevate the laptop high enough for the convection principle to work in realityOn the plus side the Coolpad does insulate your laptop from the desk surface thus preserving your desktop as well as prevening spilled coffee from soaking up the bottom of your laptop computer
The upper metal plate also rotates which is nice for showing others the screen or when you use the laptop while watching TVBut the Coolpad doesn't do its main job right hence it's useless
If you want something that can really cool your laptop look for a cheap product called "Bytecc Notebook Cooler" which has two built-in fans
I think there's an error with Amazon confusing reviews of the Targus Chill Pad/Mat with the Coolpad
Therefore this review is specifically for the CHILL PAD aka CHILL MATI've had the CHILL PAD for a week now and it performs exactly as described
It has definitely reduced the heat that my Powerbook G4 releases by at least 10*F estimation
Usually I would just put my laptop on top of my pillow and then put them both over my lap because the heat is too unbearable for my legs
I know that is dangerous but I didn't have a Chill Pad until a week ago
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS AT HOME EITHERThe Chill Pad comes in an aluminum colored textured plastic
In other words the pad is not smooth
The fans are placed on the top of the cooler in the middle so it doesn't really get in the way of my Powerbook G4's fans which are on the sides
There's an on/off switch attached to the USB/Power adapter cord
The cord is short so there isn't an extra long and annoying cord that you'd have to carry around
The Pad isn't too thick either
It is as thick as my laptop - about an inch in heightPersonally I would like the Targus Chill Pad much better if there were a sign on the package that said "THIS CHILL PAD IS ONLY SUITABLE FOR 12" NOTEBOOKS OTHERWISE IT IS TOO SMALL FOR 15" NOTEBOOKS ESP
WITH WIDESCREEN"
In addition there's this warning smallprint that says "This product contains chemicals including lead known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm
Wash hands after handling"
Okay so knowing that most laptop owners are usually on the go why would you make a cooling Chill Pad that had dangerous chemicals including lead in it?
Even though this Chill Pad has amazing potentials there are plenty of NON-CARCINOGENIC notebook coolers out there that can perform just as well with a longer width
As a result I'm returning my Chill Pad today
The chill pad in the picture silver rectangle is NOT the model that's shipped today
The model pictured is the older model item #21 and it was great
It was made of very sturdy plastic and VERY quietly cooled my laptop like a refrigerator
My only complaint with it was that the switch on the cable got brokenThe new ones have the exact same model number PA248U only the new one is item #22 but is a brownish gray curved like an hourglass and the switch is on the pad not the cable
Targus was either dumb or deceptive on the model number
This model is a piece of junk it apparently uses less rigid plastic runs very loudly until the plastic heats up
Then the fans hit the inside of the housing and either quit working or make even louder scraping sounds
I bought two thinking I was getting the original pads and thought I'd try them out
Oddly they both become defective right after the Amazon return date
Don't waste your money
I've been through two of these chill pads in the last month
The reason is the power connector it's at the back of the pad
If you ever use your laptop actually on your lap for example sitting on a bed you're going to keep bumping into that connector
The connector itself is cheap and doesn't fit well into the cooler's socket
The result is that it eventually breaks off and stops working
If you use your laptop anywhere other than on a desk I would strongly recommend skipping this one and getting the Antec cooler instead http//wwwamazoncom/gp/product/B0000BVYTV
Its a rare day when Im willing to give something 5 stars
Today is one of 'emI have an Emachines laptop with a 154" widescreen and plenty of processing power
Meaning my laptop is about as wide as they come and runs about as hotSummer just came round my neck of the woods and in my hot little house my hot little laptop couldnt hack it
I had it on a table and by mid afternoon it shut down
And wouldnt restart
The top was hot to the touch and the bottom just as bad
So I got one of these Targus Chill Mats figuring a couple little fans would help a bitThey did more than help
Im convinced they saved the life of my laptop
My once hot-enough-to-fry-a-pie harddrive now tops out at a reasonable warm
Id say the air under my machine went from 95 to 60
Its not cool enough to refresh a beer but its more than cool enough to allow my machine to stay on and operational all dayAt 11 3/4" by 9" its smaller than my laptop but the feet on my machine still fit on it just fine
As I wouldnt expect Targus to make these in 3 sizes I think they chose a good route
Slightly smaller means itll fit nicely under any laptop is more likely to fit in accessory pockets in bags its only 1/2" thick and leaves more room for the airflow you obviously need
So I cant fault it thereBetween my machines feet and the little rubber bumpers on the Mat my machine is stable on it and its stable on its own feet
I cant tell the difference between typing on it or on a table
Despite the slightly smaller sizeOnly having one little cable which I keep bundled and twist-tied to the shortest length possible running between the two is totally unobtrusive and easy to deal with
And dont even think about the sound
I honestly didnt even realise it was on at firstThe best $30 Ive spent on my computer in a long time
And spending that now sure saves the cost of replacing burnt out partsThat was all written over two years ago
Here's an updateAfter near constant use my Targus died
It starting making lots of noise
And after careful deconstruction and dedusting it was still noisy
So I replaced it 
The product worked great for about a week
Then the blades of the fan started to fall out one by one
Then it had a machine type oder
The fans continued to get stuck
Now only on fan works
Would not recommend this product
It's a waist if time and money
I bought mine in store and after less than a month of very light handling the cable had pulled loose from the USB connector exposing the wires
Despite my attempts to prevent any further damage the wires broke within a couple of days rendering my pad completely useless
I bought this chill pad some time ago
It is not at all good
Just after use of a month or so  the wiring became loose and now i have to keep it at a specific angle to keep the fans running
Fan's run slow also 
Not as good as other products in the market
The picture they have for this item is wrong
I wanted to receive the old chill mat but they shipped the new model
The new model is a different shape and runs louder
Make sure which one you want
Instead of receiving Targus PA248U I was sent Targus AWE12US looks exactly the same but without the USB hub instead
The AWE12US fan while strong is annoyingly loud
I owned a Targus PA248U for three years before it died and wish Amazon would have sent me the exact replacement I had ordered instead of "upgrading" the itemi'm giving this item 5 stars based on my first purchase and the AWE12US 1 star
I have had to purchase this item locally on four count 'em four different occasions
The pad works great for about 3 or 4 months then just shuts down
It's cheap enough and the only option locally so I kept buying it
Now that the 4th has shut down I've had more than enough hassel and will be purchasing another pad here on Amazon
It works but be prepared for it to not be a permanent solution to your laptop cooling needs
This product is very flimsy
do not buy it
will not last for mroe than a few weeks unless you baby it
I bought one of these to go with the new laptop my husband gave me
It does work to keep your legs cool
While it worked it did what it said - kept my computer cool
It was not the quietest but not super noisyIt worked for less than a month
I returned it got another one
It worked for about 2 months
So I had to deal with Targus
No go on the return
They told me it was a problem caused by misusing it
It had a little on/off toggle installed in the USB cable
Both times it came unwired
Parts stuck outIt was not turned on or off more than once
My computer sits on the desk
I don't even generally move it to sit it on my lap
I did that with the first chill mat
With the second I did not move it
Left it on the desk just unplugged the USB end of the cord
It came unwired anywayDon't buy this one buy one that will work
I had been using this for many years before I discovered the Allsop Metal Art Laptop Stand
The CoolPad is great
The swivel feature is handy
It comes with several little plastic risers with rubber tips
This allows me to adjust the elevation
The rubber tips keep the laptop from slippingWhen I upgraded to a larger laptop Dell Inspiron 9400 the CoolPad was a bit too small
The little bar doesn't help that muchI tried several products until I discovered the Allsop
The CoolPad is still a great product and probably better for smaller laptops
It's also more portable
I used to take it with me everywhereBoth are good at keeping the laptop cooler
This is supposed to greatly increase battery life
I used a freeware system monitor utility to see if this thing actually brought down HDD CPU and GPU temperatures
Low and behold it actually did reduce them all by 2 to 5 degrees or more depending on the load of the computerI also used this little guy to sit underneath my Xbox360 - a device known to produce extreme temperatures
I can't make an objective assessment of this technique but the cooling is clearly much better than when the xbox is sitting on the carpet
Based on the results from my laptop test this definitely gives me peace of mind when running the Xbox for Xtended periods of time
I have had this since January 2008
It has done a very decent job of helping to cool my Dell 1525 laptopWhich does a decent enough job on its own i must admit
Yes the picture is different and it is made of plastic
If you are a busines user I do not know if this will help but for Home use on a normal scale I would say this product helps to keep the Laptop coolPS My brother has an HP Laptop and is a Journalist
he uses his laptop a lot
His Laptop Fan does not do a good job at all of keeping cool
This Product has helped tremendouslyAlso Best Buy are selling this for $31
If you have a notebook that runs warm then this fan system should be fine
However if your notebook is hot to the touch this product does not have enough cooling powerIt is relatively quiet and fits my laptop with 14" screen well but just can't keep it cool
I'm trying to replace an external USB fan that I had which was a little loud but had great cooling powerI'm going to return this product and try theThermaltake Mobile Fan II External USB Cooling Fan - UsUpdate on July 11 I returned the Targus and bought the Thermaltake and love it
It has over 50% more airflow over 25% less noise and is built very solid
Note that the Thermaltake needs to sit on a surface next to your computer or any other device that you want to cool so if you actually need something that will sit on your lap this will not work for you
But if you are always working on a surface the Thermaltake is a great product
It was even half the price of the Targus a few days ago but looks like they've reduced the Targus now to $11 it was about $20
My recommendation would be to pay the extra 1 dollar for the Thermaltake if you have a surface to work on
I would like to start off by saying that I am very pleased with this product it's very light keeps my computer cool and doesn't need to be plugged into the wall
The Chill Pad sits comfortably on your lap or on your desk
I have a 17'' laptop and it sits fine on the chill pad to sit perfectly fine it would have to be about 2 inches wider but it does a superb job keeping it cool with its current size
I purchased this one as oppose to the other 4 or so popular ones because it was on sale currently it is listed at $25 it is not worth that muchI have a cheap dell so it overheats and this cooler does a good job at keeping it cool
It's not the most powerful thing in the world but it gets the job done unless your laptop major overheats
My laptop fan is directly over one of the cooler's fan so it worked out well for me but it might not for other people since its focus point is whats picturedProIt is a closed backside meaning you can keep it on your desk or put it on your lap
I keep it on almost all the time - sometimes even at night when I'm sleeping and I don't hear any noise at all 6 feet awayConThe usb cable is too long
Its hard to clean since you have to reach from the back to the middle or the top in - but who really cleans them?
The plastic and 4 black button thingy on the back it actually fell off but you don't really need it is cheap
After about nine months of use the cord part starts to get silly - I have to bend it in a certain way for it to work - with the help of a rubber band
First of all the cooler I got looks nothing like the picture
It's more hourglass-shaped than rectangular
That makes it hard to firmly hold the laptop and the cooler at the same time when lifting themWhich leads directly to my next point the cooler won't tolerate any drop at all even the one foot length of the USB cable
Mine broke two fan blades it happened the first day I had itIt still works but it vibrates quite a bit on my lap or I would have given it one star haIt does prevent the laptop from cooking my legs which is what I bought it for
But I doubt it'll last the week
I have owned two of these
The first one just quit after about a week
Fortunately I was able to exchange it at the retail location where I obtained it
The second one has lasted longer but has recently died
The unit is not very durable in my opinion for everyday useThe on-off toggle switch is easily broken off thus rendering any control over on-off variability useless
This happened in both models I owned shortly after purchase
The fan grills are made of formed plastic--as is the entire unit--but the grill pieces are thin and also easily snapped off
If a piece of it gets down inside forget any kind of notions you had about a quiet laptop coolerHonestly if I had paid $20 I would say it was ok for the money
But it was not worth $30 to me as it lacked durabillity
I won't purchase another
I would not recommend this product
During the first week a blade broke off one of the fans and during the next 2 weeks 2 more blades broke off
Plus I haven't noticed that it keeps my laptop any cooler than without the pad
All it does is drain the battery
I have not used the product inappropriately - it's just junk
The Targus Chill Pad helps keep your lap and laptop cool
I got an upgraded version its a bit sleeker and looks better
The cord is long enough to easily reach any USB port on my laptop
There is also an on-off button next to the cord on the pad
My version also has vents on the sides to let air come in even when you have the main vents on the bottom blocked with your lap
A very good product I am happy with it
=
Targus PA248U Notebook Chill PadI have two of these
Both worked fine for awhile but now each has thrown a bearing or something because they both sound like jet engines
That makes both unuseable
pad works as stated although wired connection to pad sticks way out in the back
Also the resting pads only in the four corners doesn't support my laptop correctly eg
one of the rubber pads makes contact with my laptop's battery instead of the laptop's frame
Targus PA248U is not worth the cardboard box it came in
Seemed to run fine for about 3 weeksthen developed a buzz
When I disconnected it to take a look three fan blades fell out of the casing
Now the fans spin without the buzzing noisethat's been replaced with vibration and loud hum due to the imbalance in the fans
I recommend you do not purchase this piece of garbage
While this product did last me for more than a year without malfunction I recently bought the Pacific Cooler which is much better
Given the choice between the two I would not buy this laptop cooler again
This cooler worked great - at first
The cooler itself did a fine job
However the USB cord that connected it to my laptop pulled apart at two different places and exposed the inner electrical wires
After a week of the wires being exposed the cooler stopped working completelyIf you don't mind spending  bucks every few months go ahead and get this - because a few months is as long as it's going to last you
It does what it says it doesBut it didn't prevent my laptop from getting too hot to touchSilent so you may not be aware it is workingIt collects far too much dust for a device that is supposed to exhaust the hot air out the louvers in the back
I would have expected to see the dirt behind the laptop
not underneath it
After I bought this it worked for a month and then died
It was never beaten up or taken anywhere just sat on my desk
I packed it up with a copy of the receipt and sent it back to the manufacturer and never heard from them again even after writing a second time
For pity's sake don't buy one of these
I got this to keep my laptop from setting my lap on fire
It worked pretty well if I moved it so that one of the fans was actually under the CPU
This sort of threw the whole system into an oddly unbalanced set up unless I was at my desk
But then after less than a month of use the power switch on it broke off leaving disconnected wires and no power
I got out the wire strippers and put the thing back together temporarily but this thing is just poorly made
Its not a notebook cooler if the fans won't spinWhat I did like about this is that it is lightweight so it doesn't add extra pounds to my already too heavy bag and the fans ran pretty quiet
This is the second chillpad that I have purchased
I work at home 8 - 10 hours a day and this is a MUST HAVE if you spend that kind of time on a laptop
The first Targus chillpad I purchased lasted for three years almost 24/7/365
Quality product and extends the life of your laptop because it won't overheat
Does the trick but the power cord pooped out on me twice
I got a replacement which was awesome but it stopped working after a month just like the first one
I still use the pad though and its helpful
this cooler stoped my computer from overheating if you take care of if it will last you longer just dont turn off the fans at all because the on/off switch seems to break easly im happy with mine
The product works as advertised
The order was shipped promptly
Great service
My son recommended this product to me because my laptop was always getting hot and shutting off while I was using it
Since I have been using the Chill Pad it has not turned off once
I only wish I had looked at the dimensions because it is a little bit smaller than my laptop and there is a bigger one available
i had very good service i like the unit only wish it had a usb extra hub to plug other add ons but for the price does keep laptop cooler 
I recently purhase the Targus PA248U Tornado Notebook Chill Pad
And I am very happy with it so far
Before purchasing the chill pad my notebook would run extremity hot
Now I don't play that many games on my notebook
But I do watch a lot of movies on it
Before useing the chill pad my movie watching was very limited to one maybe two movies at a time than my notebook would become to hot to use
But with the chill pad I seem to be able to watch one movie after another with no problem
And I'm sure the chill pad would work the same for people who play a lot of games as well
The construction of the pad is good
The wiring on the latest model
Is a lot better than on the older one
There's also a model that comes with UBS ports on it
In conclusion the Targus Chill Pad is a good inexpensive way to keep your notebook cool and in good working order
I have had my Gateway 400 laptop for over three years and it's still kicking
However one annoying feature about Gateway 400's is that they have a very loud cooling fan
In fact my friends joke around that my laptop runs off diesel because the fan is so loudI got the Targus PA248U yesterday and was amazed at how well it worked
I use my laptop for about 10 hours a day and the loud "diesel" fan has only come on onceI can't speak for how it works on other laptops but it is great for the Gateway 400
I saw this item in several stores and resisted buying
Then I found it on amazon for cheaper than in the stores and got it
I am so glad I did
I've had my iBook sitting on this thing for several hours now and only one corner is even SLIGHTLY warm whereas if it was in my lap the whole bottom would be very hot
It is whisper quiet and does its job very wellIf you have a laptop but this now
I just thought I'd add my 2 cents here because it seems like this item has gotten it's fair share of bad reviews
I've got a really bad back so I spend a lot of my time on the couch lying down and my notebook would get so hot from my clothing or blankets
Since I got my Chill Pad my notebook has never overheated and it has managed to survive through 2 notebooks
I've never had a problem with it all and I've owned it for about 3 years nowI bought one for my friend a year ago and she has managed to break the power cord twice so I'll agree with the bad design there
I've found that by tying up the cord I use a velcro cable tie it doesn't get yanked out and stays out of the way
I've suggested that she do the same next time around
To be honest I think the on/off switch could be removed since the pad powers off when the laptop is turned offAll in all I think this is a pretty decent product for cooling down your notebook and it's well worth the money
I have a Toshiba A75-S211 32 GHz 512 MB ram ATI Radeon 9000 w/ 64 MB
I have had problems with it getting hot since I got it back in January
Once the fan actually burned out so I had to have it sent off
I wanted to buy a chillpad with a fan so I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore
I accidentally bought this one but I couldn't be happier
This is lightweight so I carry it in my notebook bag all the time it swivels and it keeps my notebook cool
Two thumbs up from me
Plusit's cheap
My laptop doesn't overheat and malfunction it's just too warm to comfortably use on my lap for extended periods while it's plugged in
When running on battery power it's a little cooler but still uncomfortableI took a gamble that this would help and it paid off
This thing not only keeps my lap from overheating but keeps it cool
"Chill Pad" isn't much of an exageration as a name for this nice deviceThe Chill Pad is a little small for my rather large notebook a Dell Lattitude D800 but it still works fine
It's very light weight and thin
I wouldn't think twice about extra weight or space when carrying it around with my laptop
It's also very quiet
In a quiet room I can hardly hear it and it's no louder than the laptop fan which seems to run a lot less when the Chill Pad is under it
It a room with any background or white noise forget it you'll never hear itThe fans draw in air from the top between the pad and the laptop and exhaust out the back of the Chill Pad towards the knees
It moves enough air though that it's not even warm on my kneesThe only suggestions I would have to make this slightly better would be to make the usb/power cord shorter
Would anyone ever really need it to be 3 feet long?
The extra cord is just in the way even if you have it bundled up--which of course I do
There's also a power switch on the cord
Seems kind of dumb to have a switch on there at all
Why would you not want this thing on if it's plugged in?
And if you did want it off it would certainly be quicker and easier to unplug the cord from the usb port on the laptop or the power-in connector on the Chill Pad than to fumble around trying to find and manipulate the tiny switch on the cordBut that's a pretty small complaint for a useful device that exceeded all my expectations on it's primary function
It keeps my laptop and my lap top cool
i have a dell inspiron whose cooling system is junk
i got this pad abt a month ago it really keeps it cool
it makes little noise which sometimes become annoying
rest it does its job
I live in El Salvador
I just bought an Averatec 3220 laptop and this chill pad
Hey
They are just the same size 121" screen laptop and even though i work without A/C the double fans keeps the laptop as cool as if I have just turned it on
And remember i live in the tropics
I certainly recomend it
Yes it could be faster but the fans would make a lot more noise and drain more power
I've owned two of these now and my biggest complaint is the USB power cord
I have to jiggle it now to get the fans to turn
The first Chill Pad I bought lasted approximately eight to ten months
It's power cord was then lost in a move so I bought a replacement
The second Chill Pad has lasted less than one month
I'm planning to contact Targus but considering that I no longer have the receipt and the product is a month old I'm not hopeful
All in all it has done it's job but I wouldn't recommend this particular model
It's quiet inexpensive and totally worth it
My tablet lap top was over heating all the time and freezing-up as a result now it is cool to the touch after hours of use amazing
Like this product for several reasons- Lightweight
I carry it to work every day and while traveling- Compact
Easy to carry whether on travel or not- Great swivel feature
Great when sharing the screen with the person next to you- Good for ergonomics
Without it I find myself shifting my hands to an awkward position or I end up shifting the laptop
Now I just nudge it left or right
Very quiet light and slim
The only issue I have is that it is a bit small for a 15 inch laptop
Other then that it works great
This fan may cosmetically cool the outer casing of your laptop but claims that it actually cools the processor are totally bogusI have a Gateway laptop that I use for very compute-intensive workloads that can run from hours to days
Running the processor for that long can cause thermal shutdowns so I rigged together a $10 solution using blocks and a fan
It was unwieldly but it worked
I thought the Targus would be a better solution since it claims to be designed for just this sort of thing
The weak fans cool the outer casing but does nothing for the processor because the thermal shutdowns returnedIf you want to cool your lap this may work fine
If you want to cool your actual computer look elsewhere
I purchased this the same day I purchased my newest laptop
I've had a few laptops but none were my own so I wanted to be sure I protected my investment
The reason I purchased this product was because it was all I could find in my area and I did not want to wait for shipping
It made a huge difference in cooling my Laptop's temperature down but it only worked for two weeks
I have no idea why it stopped it has not been mishandled and there is nothing wrong with the cord that I can see
It is also difficult to use in conjunction with a tilted table or laptop stand the laptop tends to slide off of it
Very disappointing I wish I had saved my packaging so I could get a refund
The main problem is with the electrical connector
You have to wiggle it to make it works
After a while you have to wiggle it more and hopeDon't buy this product until they decide to use a $010 connector instead of a $005 connector
I purchased this product about 2-3 months ago and it has already quit working
It did do an okay job but what a waste of money it has turned out to be
It is worth purchasing a better-quality laptop cooler
I'm disabled so I'm on my laptop in bed most of the day & night
I was so tried of the laptop getting hot on the bottom
This laptop cooler really is working well for me
It's been a great blessing for my lap
I have never owned a different one so I have no way to compare it
I hear no sound when I turn it on
It seems to work great
As a college student I find it necessary to keep my laptop on for days on end
It would sit on top of a plastic blotter and within the span of a few weeks the heat coming from the laptop warped the plastic
Within SECONDS of placing this product under my laptop the computer stopped spewing heat and the chassis cooled downOverall an excellent buy
Worth it's weight in gold
I purchased the Targus CoolPad Notebook lift and it did help cool down the notebook some but was not pleased with the quality and the amount it cooled down
I felt my notebook was not well protected from slipping while using itI returned it and purchased another product that I am very well pleased withMy notebook is very secure on it and it does keep my notebook much cooler than the Targus did
I bought this item for my daughter who just purchased a computer - she really likes it especially that it swivels
These chinese made motors are really the cheapest possibleMine stopped working after only a month
Basically junk as other reviewers have noted
Targus has been good about replacements in the past but I will try for a refund from CompUSA
It is hard to tell that the fans are on
It seems a bit cheap to me
I bought this because my laptop was getting very hot on the bottom and finally crashed causing me to lose all of my data
I do not like that I have only one choice to use the device which is to take up one of my two USB ports
I was reading the "advice" to use a muffin pan for your laptop
Well I think people have used stuff like that I've used an empty box for when I put my laptop on a cloth covered surface like my bed but I mean c'mon that gets old after awhile
I'm not going to travel around with muffin pans not gonna do it not that CHEAP
LOL
our inspirion 8200 notebook kept getting so hot when i was using it while sitting it on my lap"laptop" anyway it would get so hot at times it would leave burns on my leg in desparation to helpmy husband gave me a cupcake/muffin baking pan i simply turned it over and placed the computer on it
Wha-la our laptop stays much cooler and no longer shuts down and we didn't have to spend any money
Just a little good ole fashion ingenuity

I have had this for about 5 days now and it has worked pretty good for the first few days
Now i will look under my notebook every so often and the fans are shut off
I have to fiddle with the power cord for it to turn back on
A simple rotation of the cord around the power hole seems to get the fans going but i can't imagine this will hold up much longerThe one thing I like about this is that the cord is long
This is sometimes a distraction but when i am near a deskop I can plug it into that computer instead of my notebook even if it is on the floor below
The product worked fine for few weeks but then one of the fans went off- balance
Product still cools fine but makes the most horrible screeching noise
It is very possible i got a bad product as I am a big fan of Targus
Needless to say though i am investigating other means of keeping my MBP cool
Works great for cooling your laptop
After 1 day I noticed that the wires near the on/off switch were exposed
I had to keep pushing the cable back in to get it to work
Today it completely stopped working
I just ordered a new cooler different brand
For now I just turned it over and put it under my laptop
It lets air get under there so it does keep it cool just not the way its supposed to
I like this product but it was not in good condition when I received it
damn it
Thanks for having it in stock and your prompt delivery
I was concerned about the news recently about all the trouble with battery fires now that concern is covered
You're money is better spent on another productIt's made out of plastic so it feels cheaply made
A nice thing about the product is that the fans are incredibly quiet damn near silent if it isn't damaged
I had one fan made a scraping noiseThe fans are designed to draw the heat from the laptop but I've found that these coolers are less effective than the laptop coolers that blow cool air in
My MacBook hasn't really gotten hot yet with my new Chill Pad
This is the second chill pad that I've owned
They work very well to keep your laptop cool and to protect your lap or other surface from getting hot from the computer
However these are not made with impact-tolerant plastic
My old one finally bit it after one too many drops from table top height
The cord is also about two feet longer than it needs to be
It had a tendancy to get caught in walk-by entanglements which would yank the cord out of the side of the unit thereby eventually damaging that connection
I wrapped the cord for my new unit in a cable tie to prevent that since you only need 8 to 12 inches to reach from the connector port to the computer's USB port
I bought Targus because of it's price and ratings on Amazon
I'm disappointed with the results I've gotten from this product
After a month or so the fans stopped working
I received the same product from a friend and only after a few minutes of work the fans stopped working yet again
It has been my conclusion that the fans stop working at a certain temperature ironic isn't it?
I still have both Chill Pads and when they occasionally stop working I switch one for the other
All that money wasted
Well I purchased this item for my Gateway 4026GZ laptop cuz I noticed it was running a little sluggish and a friend told me try getting a cooling pad and see if it runs the computer a little cool and give it more speed
So I tried it and I can't really tell if it's working or not
I installed new memory chips and now got 1GB
So I don't know if it's the memory chips making it run faster or the fact that there's a cooling pad
I still feel hot air blowing outta the side of my laptop
P On Winter months I use it as a hand warmer that's how warm the air is
Kinda like a laptop with a mini heater on the side
But it seems to be working find via USB port and not too loud of a sound
I can't say I'd recommend it cuz I don't know if it's even making a difference but at the price you're paying for it
All I can say is just TRIAL and ERROR 
Buy it and you see for yourself if it's JUNK or TREASURE
This is the only laptop cooler I've tried
It does seem to be helping but it's not the dramatic result I was looking forMy laptops been on for an hour surfing the web and it's hot enough that I'm ready to turn it off and let it have a break alreadyThat said for the price it was worth it
I bought this product the first time in August
By late September/early October the fan stopped turning on
I'd flip the switch and nothing would happenThen I returned it b/c it was still w/in the 90 days to return for Amazon
Got a new one b/c I thought the one I had was defective
It worked until early December but by then I was studying for my first round of law school finals so obviously I didn't have time to spend returning the itemI discovered in December that if I carefully switched the switch to a certain point very delicately in just the right position somewhere between the middle and on it would work
But if I made the slightest movement it would stop the fans againNow the 90 days has passed and I'm stuck w/ it
Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't
I'm buying another brand and hopefully that will be better
Targus Chill Mat is simply two fans in a slim box
Product is more cheaply made than I thought but it does exactly what they say it does and it really works
I bought it after my company's recommendation of it to keep my laptop cool
I've got a powerbook and this keeps it at an elevation that is very comfortable for my hands and shoulders at the same time
I can rotate the platform freely so as to adjust my angle of view or to share the screen with others
It keeps my computer very cool and allows for almost the entire bottom of the laptop to be exposed to air so that air-flow limits how hot your computer getshighly recommended it travels easy since it dis-assembles like LEGO pieces and is a great cheap alternative to many of the ergonomic elevators or cooling pads out thereIT'S GREAT

Even tho this is pretty cheap it totally doesn't cool down my notebook PC so it's just a piece of totally useless metal plate
In theory it should lift up your notebook to allow better air flow at the bottom but in reality no it doesn't have any cooling affect at all
It's cheap but still a waste of money for a student like myself
I use a laptop at homeon my lap
I've gone thru two of these units now
The first unit lasted only about 2 weeks but I'd lost the receipt so couldn't do anything about getting money back
So I bought another and it lasted about 4 months until it started to not really work well and now a total of 7 months into ownership it finally died completely
The concept is great
The product is cheaply made and doesn't last as long as it should
Computer stores sell this product for like $40insaneToday I'm buying a different brandwe'll see
With so many people choosing to buy laptops computers today we often hear overheating that causes these computers to burn out and the batteries to catch on fire
That can all change with the flick of the switch
Targus has made that all possible with the Tornado Notebook Chill Pad
This is a convient pad that you place below your laptop and it cools down the heat that comes from operating and typing on your laptop
The mat is also powered by simply plugging in your pad through the USB ports and just simply flicking the switch on
It works like a charm and without any external power from an AC Adapter
I definitely recommened this for anybody who owns or wants to buy a laptop computerPrice AConvience B+Overall A-
I'm in the habit of sitting on my bed or sofa and using my laptop and I bought this so I would be able to play Warcraft without burning my legs
It worked pretty well for about a year and then the fans died
Figuring that it had been dropped or otherwise mishandled I went out to buy another one
It died after a month
Fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me
I went back to using my senior yearbook as a heat shield rather than buying a third
It gets two stars instead of one because it actually kept my computer and my lap comparitively coolstill you'd be better off cooling your laptop with a ziplock baggie full of ice
Yes the cord is too long
yes I've hooked it a few times and almost put my notebook on the floor
BUT it makes my Ferrari 4006 - that previously could be used as a hair dryer or popcorn popper after only a few minutes - totally cool both to the touch and out the ventIf you have a 154 widescreen like the Ferrari exact same chassis as the travelmate and new macbook but the ferrari's AMD64 runs way way hotter then either the solo or duo intels way better chip has it's cost don't worry it is fine the puter is wider but it's held securely by the rubber pinsMajor TRUE & NOTICEABLE difference over just having a non-fanned air-venting "lap desk"
Originally I was only using this when at home but now it goes in the case with the puter and I use it at every tableLook it's cheap enough to buy a couple about half the price of one good thick computer book right?
Everything breaks this is worth having a spare and living with a 6 month individual lifespan
I bought this after my laptop overheated 4 times during some games that used intense graphics
So far no more problems
It allows heat from the bottom of the computer to diffuse into the air
It also inclines the keyboard for more comfortable typing
The cons It brings a little less stability than a tabletop surface and it would impede any front mounted CD-ROM drive
However I'm glad it extends the life of my laptop
Well worth the money
I LOVE THIS PRODUCT
Why spend all that money on a product with fans when this product does the job that it is intended for
My laptop does not get hot now with this product
I bought this product an I do believe less than a month later it stopped working
I also have a friend that purchased it and it stopped working a few weeks after she bought it
I really regret buying this
Inexpensive lightweight and really cools down my laptop
The one I bought from Best Buy didn't last for more than a month the fan just stopped working for some reason
However the one that I got from Amazon works perfectly
Laptops get hot sometimes very hot indeed
Mine is no exception
So I bought this little gizmo to help reduce the problem and save my laptop from the excessive stress that heat was causingIt does the jobI'm a happy camper with a cooler laptop
And I'm grateful that it runs off the laptop itself so I don't have to go hunting for a free outlet to plug it inPerfect?
No
There is still some heat accumulation but compared to the heat before I began using it it's minimal
Reduced heat has to be extending the life of my machineIf you have a laptop that heats up consider using a chill pad
I'm glad I did and do
I bought the Chill Pad as I was tired with my old Dell laptop overheating
The Chill pad is surprisingly light and fits nicely on the lap
The fans work fine and my new HP pavilion has not over-heated yet
I had high hopes for this product which is perhaps why I'm not giving it a high ratingThis Chill Pad simply does not work
The idea is great I'd love something that takes the heat away from my MacBook Pro but this simply doesn't do it
My hands and lap are sweating as I type this reviewFor $20 I can't really complain
But buyer's beware this won't magically take away all of the heat
It does provide some sort of shield between your lap and your laptop but a book or newspaper can provide the same protection
The fans do little to no cooling
I loved it when I first bought it but after approx
4 months it really started getting loud
Whenever it was on it sounded like a jet
I owned this for alittle over a year and recently threw it away because the fans were working inconsistently
Light weight and easy to use
There are no cables or fans to deal with
I can work with my notebook computer in my lap for hours without my notebook or lap getting too hot
Great price terrific product
I found this product to exceed expectations
It keeps my laptop cool and the fans are extremely quiet
You won't be disappointed
I bought one of these almost exactly a year ago for my old Averatec laptop since the thing overheats so bad that it melted/warped/broke the AC jack in my laptop less than a year after I bought it luckily the warranty covered it
Therefore it only made sense to buy something to prevent such a nuisance from happening again
For whatever reason after owning a Chill Pad for around 8 months it began to work sporadically often requiring me to jiggle or rotate the cord going into the Chill Pad in order to get the fans to operate and a couple months later it stopped functioning completelyConsidering that it's widely available for about $20 I wasn't expecting it to run forever but at the very least a year's worth of use should be expected
The product more or less protects your legs rather than cooling your laptop so this should be used as a cheap or short-term solution
I myself will be looking into an aluminum chill pad in the near future and I suggest others with the extra money to spend to do the same as well
I have this chill pad and all I can say is I wish we had taken it back
It is not good if you like to use your laptop on your couch on your lap it might be better on a hard surface
If you use it on your lap the laptop will constantly be sliding off the unit
We have had ours for a little over a year and the fans just went out not that they cooled that well in the first place
I wouldn't waste your money if you want something you can use for a while
BUY A ZALMAN
I purchased this chill mat and it worked for a short period of time
The connector would not stay in because it was a prong-type connector and not a USB connector
The company sent me a new cord but it would not stay in either
I tried every which way to support the connector so it would stay in but finally gave upBought the Zalman and it has a variable fan which is almost silent and haven't had a moment's problem with itYou won't regret going with the Zalman
I recently ordered 44 cooling pads from AMAZONCOM in 2 separate orders 20 and 24
I do not have any issues with product itself nonetheless the packaging was not good
All cooling pads in the first order were removed from their original box and made it easier for them to break during shipping and extremely difficult for me to reship them
That was my only concern
Overall i am very satisfied with the product and i will order more of this product
Amazon is excellent in term of security an protection sellers vs buyersTargus PA248U Notebook Chill Pad
have been using this daily for a while now and the fans are weak
it does circulate the air but not with very much force as my last cool pad did
it is still working and with my new computer the pc fan rarely comes on
with my old laptop the pc fans would run constantly when watching movies
i wouldn't recommend this pad for any serious cooling needs
It works as good as a pricey pad it shares the same set back as all of them with the faluty cords that like to short out but iv not own a pad that did not have that issue
great buy tho
I received the package
When I went to plug it in to use it it didn't work
Plain and simple
The product also was put together very cheezy
I had this product for about three years and one day decided to try to clean it
I broke it trying to clean it it was my fault and my current fan simply is not as goodI have an original MacBook and they have a known tendency to run hot so my friend and I bought this product
This product noticeably lowered my computer temperature that I check by using the iStat widget
The dual fan is also great because if one breaks or isn't running as well as the other you still get some cooling
The general design and lift also keep the computer a little cooler by allowing airflowThey were out of stock or not shipping from Amazon when I got my new one but hindsight being 20-20 I would have paid the extra 3 dollars to get this product instead
Ive had this cooling pad for a few weeks now and have used it for numerous hours and i haven't had one bit of problem out of it
It puts out a lot of air and isn't loud at all
Its very simple
Sit your laptop on top of cooling pad plug cord into USB port and push the on button and your set to go
No complaints at all
Before purchasing this cooling pad i purchased the Targus Laptop Chill Pad - PA248Y01U and it was the cheapest made thing i had ever seen and it didn't even work
I bought it and plugged it in and the cord or the cooling pad itself had a short of some sort in it and it you had to move the cord constantly to get it to work until finally it just stopped working it got returned after the first day
When it did work it hardly put out any air at all
I then purchased this one and im very satisfied
soon within months of using this product the wiring was not working
this seller quickly sent me a new wiring which worked perfectly for a year but not has stopped working again
the manufacturer was unwilling to send me a new wire since it is now out of warranty
my roommate has this same item and her wiring doesn't work either
granted the product works fairly well while in warranty but the wire that connects from the laptop to the cooling pad is not built to last for more than a year
The cooling mat was okay at first although it has never been very portable because of the bulky shape
Within a month the fans started "sputtering" and turning off whenever they wanted until one day they stopped turning on at all
We still use it as a barrier between the computer and legs but it works the same as a book which I am sure you can find around your house for free
This light weight notebook chill pad keeps my lap top cool and is quiet while it's doing it
I added a usb extension port so I can plug this and a usb wifi hook up in at the same time
Very pleased
I got my first laptop this year and within a month had to have 3 major parts replaced due to over heating
So I got the Chill Pad and from day 1 it has worked
I can feel no raised temp from under or above the pad
The only thing that keeps me from giving this a 5 star is that the fan has gone out after less then a month
Targus covers the pad with a 1 year warrenty and are replacing it totallyTargus PA248U Notebook Chill Pad
For my dell vostro core 2 duo 220 Ghz it brings down idle cpu temperature to 22C from 28C and high activity temperature to 45C from 54CRuns quietlyon/off switchno extra usb ports
The Targus Podium Coolpad is not flashy
In fact I hardly see it at all since it sits under my Macbook Pro
With it's lego-like blocks simple is sometimes better
There is a noticeable difference in the heat being put out from my notebook
The swivel base is helpful to share views with neighbors or for visibility from different desk angles
Overall this small unassuming coolpad seems to be worth the money put in to have a little piece of mind and a lot less heat
Great design does what it saysIt Keeps the laptop from getting to warmThe problem is its got some really cheesy made fans that are quiet at firstThen after a week or so they show just how cheap they areThey wine vibrate and sometime they just quitSo you have to tap it on the side to keep them going or quiet them down
I purchased the Chill Pad after seeing my brother-in-law use it
I use it with my MacBook Pro
MacBook Pro's tend to get pretty hot on the left side but the Chill Pad keeps it probably 15 degrees cooler making it much more comfortable to work on
I'm very very pleased with it
My only gripe would be that it is kind of noisy but since I usually have music playing while I work it really isn't that noticeable
I've had the previous version for about a year and was happy with it - until the power cord failed
A few times I forgot the thing was attached to my laptop's USB port and jerked the cable pretty hardSo for ten bucks I didn't hesitate to buy another
Unfortunately they've redesigned the unit doesn't look like the picture as shown on this date and the two fans are a lot noisier now
It looks better I guess but the sound is going to drive me nuts until I find a replacementCan't recommend this product
The item I received was NOT the same as the item pictured
I previously owned one of the Targus PA248U Chill Pads pictured and it was a wonderful product - small quiet and effective
So I ordered another from Amazon expecting to get the same product
However the item I received was the "next generation" of this item which is totally different than the item pictured but with the same model number
The item that was actually shipped to me was hour-glass shaped black and was EXTREMELY loud
I could actually hear the fan running from over 50 feet away
Kudos to Amazon for accepting the returned item and giving me a full refund including return shipping
I'd like to see them update the pictures on this item though so that other people don't have the same problems I did
I bought this notebook cooling pad as a birthday present for my husband about 3 years ago
Despite us not using it too often at its "peak use" we only used it about 2-3 times per week it completely died this morning
About a year ago it began making noises as if the fans were having issues getting going
I have kept the cool pad almost entirely dust free and in good condition but it just seems the Little Fans That Could spun for the last time this morningIt does keep your laptop cool and for $10 which is the price Amazon lists it at the time of the review it can't be beat for how well it works
However don't expect it to last more than 2-3 years
This product has many nice features
It does keep my laptop cool the rubber bits keep it from sliding and having it run off USB power means one less cord
But it's much louder than my MacBook fan going full bore so I don't tend to use it
This is cheap
And that is the quailty you get
I do wish the fans were not so centered but it did keep my laptop signifintally cooler but after 4 months the wires came out of the swtich and one of the blades on the fan broke so i only have one working fan
but for the price this is what you get
I was looking for this product in some other stores and Amazon just have the lowest price to offer
Aside from that the product really sets my laptop real cool
It doesn't have to suffer those long hot session during surfingIt's a great deal and the shipping of Amazon is really fast
I do not own either a Targus Podium Coolpad or a Targus ChillpadReviews mostly negative of the Targus Chillpad are showing up under the Targus Podium CoolpadThe Podium Coolpad is a fanless solution that helps cool the laptop simply by raising it up in back and a little in front and also provides a swivel function
Height is adjusted using Lego-like stacking column pieces which can go missing all too easily according to *actual* reviews of the Podium CoolpadThe Chillpad uses fans powered by the laptop through its USB connection
According to reviews you can read here it has a lot of problems with power switches and fans failingUntil the review assignment error gets resolved if you read a complaint about a switch or a fan or a USB port--it's about the Chillpad *not* the Podium Coolpad
complete waste of my money
the first time i bought it worked fine for 2 months then the stupid on off switch cable was comming apart so i bought a new one
then the new one had the same exact issue
in addition i have a 17 inch laptop this cooler barely does the work it will work fine for anything smaller than a 17 inch
i purchased a coolermaster notepal and that cooler is so much better
the only good thing with this is that it works fine if you want to work on your lap other then that i would not invest my money on this
When I first bought this product it was great
It kept my laptop cool its light weight and its very quiet
But it fell apart quickly
The on/off switch broke off and I ended up just securing the wires by hand and lots of duct tape
Then the little plastic pieces over the fans broke off
Granted I used this daily for two years and took it around the world a few times so I got a lot of use out of it
I suppose if you just keep it at home most of the time it would last a lot longerBTW I recently bought the newer version of this dark gray and thicker and it sucks its much louder than the older model
It works fine great even for a few weeks
Then it quits
I paid over twenty bucks for it so I took it back and got another one customer service didn't bat an eye
Same problem
That little switch stops working or falls off
We didn't want to take it back to the store again so we took off the switch and taped the wires together unplugging the USB from the computer when it was no longer needed
It's also an exceptionally long cord three or four feet which I feel is unnecessary and could have contributed to the problem
Now it's quit again and I don't know what to do
It works fine in the begining keeps the computer really cool but it's just put together so shoddily that it's not worth it even if it costs five bucks which it doesn'tI think it may just be Targus
I've also got one of their laptop battery chargers which occasionally though nothing has been unplugged stops working
This rarely happens but I have no explanation for it
I just look down and realize that blue light is off and my battery is half-dead though I thought I was on the charger
I check everything and nothing is loose so I try everything in order - unplug from the wall plug back in nothing - unplug from little box with light both sides nothing - unplug from computer nothing
Then I unplug everything nothing's connected to each other to the wall to the computing nothing
Plug it all back in works fine
Beats me
At least it still works after a few months unlike Targus' other stuff
this notebook cooler has been most helpful in the hot weather when you are working on you notebook and you have to have it on your lap
it keeps your lap cool as well as the notebook and very moderately priced
i love it
My notebook is happy to chill on this pad the product works well at keeping the computer cool enough so that the cpu cooling fan itself doesn't even need to run 90%+ of the time
On the more rare occassions that I'm not jammin to music or there's other miscellaneous background noise peace & quiet time basically the fans in the pad are audibly noticeable
The pad fans' sound/noise is minimal though
Using the product several hours almost daily for about 2 months and it's running great
With the wear and tear I know it will incur going forward I'll be satisfied if it runs effectively for 2 years
Indications so far seem that to be a reasonable expectation at which time I'll update my rating to 5 stars
Cheers
Off is onon is off which was ok till it stopped working completely after just a few days
I will be returning this for another one hopefully it is just a fluke 
This product so far is working really well
I love the pivot feature which I didn't think I'd really make use of but now I use it all the time
I've only had it a few weeks but I do like the new angle of my keyboard and the added height
I think it does alleviate some pressure on my wrists but I guess only time will tell
It's nice and small so it's very portable when I bring it to all the different offices I work at
A great simple to use product and a very fair price
I own two of these
One I use with my home laptop and one I take on the road
It weighs very little holds the computer at a comfortable working angle and provides better air circulation so the fan comes on very infrequently
Once I found the best working height I glued the little building blocks down and together so they don't get lost
Targus Chill padPros As with every review you have to start with something positive*crickets*Cons This device started out running fairly well I saw about 10f drops in temp when running applications that would put a load on the system where typically it would jump pretty high
That was on the first day of use
Moving to the second day I saw a very deteriorated performance value
When the laptop was put under a load It was like the cooler was not even on
Many times I had to check to make sure that the fans where even running
On the Third day of use is when the device started to act up there was a grinding noise coming from the right fan and almost no air flow
I even removed the cooler hooked it up to another computer to make sure that there was enough electricity passing on my laptop to power the device and on the other machine it had the same issue
If at all possible I would have given this device a -5 out of 5Other Thoughts pros cricket Cons - Poor Construction - Poor Heat reduction - Poor overall quality
The chill pad works great and I'm very happy with it
My only criticism is that it is a little small for my laptop
There seem to be different products pictured on this page
I have the silver Targus PA248U
It does not swivel
I am using it with a 17" HP and it is very stable
The computer hangs over the sides about 1 1/4" front and back and 1 3/4" on both sides
The computer does not slide and the cool pad does not slide
It has been keeping the computer much cooler and it is very silent
I did see a comment about the connector on the cord and can see where it could get damaged
Use a little care that it is turned so it does not get pinched and it should be fine
This is a great product for notebook owners
It allows for comfortable typing swivel abilities and gets air under your notebook
The product is easy to carry and there are adjustable rubber molds for proper height placement
A highly recommended product
I used to be one of those frustrated guys whose Toshiba notebook would overheat and power off
While Toshiba denies it the cooling system just couldn't keep up with the heat the processor produced
Someone suggested that instead of using compressed air to blow the lint that collected in the fan to use a vacuum to suck the stuff out
But even then it still overheated
But then I discovered this Targus Chill Pad
What a difference
My computer hasn't powered down once using it
I was afraid that it was be too loud whirring fans and all but honestly it is so silent
And it's so light it can be carried anywher
For anyone whose laptop powers down I recommend it highly
I gave this as a gift because my boyfriend is always saying how hot his legs get with his laptop
What he really enjoyed about the coolpad was the swivvle feature and the angle it puts the computer on
He couldn't be more happy with it
so it had more delight then originally anticipated
The shipment arrived on time like it was predicted and there was nothing that went wrong
I was very pleased
Excellent product
I was having trouble with the fan running constantly in my laptop
Since the purchase of this Chill Pad it hasn't come on once
Plus it's light and fits right in the bag with the laptop
Recommend it to all
I like the product
It helps with the heat if you have your computer on your lap
It is very lightweight and easy to carry around
The only thing I was dissappointed with is it doesn't cool off the computer as much as I would have liked
But it does elevate your computer some and keeps it off of sensitive surfaces
This is the third Coolpad I've owned and I really like it
I own a 17" MacBook Pro and the Coolpad works fine on this redesigned version sporting an added wider riser for larger laptops
You get the added benefit that the columns snap together like Legos
I have owned 2 Targus chill mats and they were the worst pieces of crap I ever bought
They last about 2 months before they stop working
Either they will just completely stop working or the fan blades will start tearing off and then stop working
After about a week they start making a loud sound like something is caught in the fan blades
Unfortunately they were the only brand available in my local stores so I had to settle
I will never trust Targus for any product ever again
Sure they offer a warranty but to be honest I'm not going to keep my receipt and warranty information in order to get them to replace the junk they sold to me with another piece of junk that will stop working in the same amount of time and charge me over half of what I paid for the product for shipping
Please do yourself a favor and forget about buying this noise maker
The chiller seems to convert your computer energy via USB into vibration noises
The air current seems to simply be a by-product of the need to rattle
Opt for a sturdier more effective chiller
I'm avoiding this brand simply out of spite
I purchased this laptop cooler last year at a retail store opting over models that cost $10 moreAt first this worked pretty well
All I needed was the edge to handle some light gaming that my laptop couldn't handle without additional cooling
It worked well in that regardThis cooler has a USB powercord but the cord terminates as a DC jack to the back of the chillmat
While some people might consider this a plus this is the single biggest failure on this item
The DC jack INPUT on the cooler itself was poorly constructed causing the fans to spin up and down for a while until eventually they wouldn't spin up at all
A laptop cooler that can't spin the fans is next to worthlessHowever this cooler has no channels for air and doesn't sit high enough from the table to even add airflow when the fans are off
In a very real sense this laptop cooler is actually WORSE than simply putting my laptop on top of a book for cooling benefitsI strongly recommend other people avoid this and find a better product
This product is wonderful
It keeps my little netbook nice and cool
I love it
It's easy to use
I would recommend disconnecting the wire from both unit and computer when storing it or putting it in your laptop bag
It's not meant for rough handling
Take care of your chill pad and it will take care of your laptop
Bought one of these a few years ago and really like it
Needed a second one but when it arrived I discovered a manufacturing error - the rear bottom pads were the same ones as on the front they are supposed to be thicker than the front ones so as to slightly elevate the rear so it doesn't wobble on the center screw
You can even see it in the photos on amazoncom So with the same pads front and rear the pad is worthless as it doesn't sit level it sits on the center screw and wobblesTried getting the correct pads directly from Targus they said to return it to the vendor
Amazon was nice enough to quickly send a replacement -- with the same problemTwo tries is enough for me off to Best Buy instead
I should have read reviews for this product before purchasing but I just picked it up quick at the store and I'm sorry I did
The product is very cheaply made
The fans make too much noise
And now after only typical usage nothing heavy or out of the ordinary not even a lot of travel the fans are working only intermittently and I am going to have to replace this product
Definitely not worth the cost
Although its a bit pricey its a really good product
You can change the height depending on how much space you need your laptop to have from the surface
It helps so much with the ventilation process
The design for this is terrible
The end of the USB cord going to the pad sticks out at least an inch so it's really easy to bump it if you use your laptop on your lap
A few bumps and the connection inside the pad becomes faulty
If you try to keep using the pad you have to move the cord around to find "sweet spots" so that the pad gets its power
This is very annoying and there doesn't seem to be any simple way to fix it
After i bought this product not on amazon it wouldnt work after a couple days cause where you plug the port into the chill mat broke
and it was kind of noisy
This Chill Pad currently being sent out is not the curved one in the photo
It is the rectangular one pictured above
I thought I was getting the curvy-sided one but the rectangular one arrivedIt works just fine for me
I was a little dismayed by the noise it makes but I got used to it quickly
It is like having another computer on nearby or something noise-wise
It cools off my Dell laptop quite well
No problems to report
I was skepticial at first
But once i started using it I was amazed
Beyond Amazed
My typing has improved and it swivels which makes it handy for when I feel like putting my feet up
The only downfall is there is an odd number of little pegs but i just use the bar
I have an HP ZD7000 notebook which is really a desktop replacement
It has a wide screen and powerful processor
These are all great features but the drawback is that it gives off so much heat that I can't put it on my lap for too long
Because it was hot on just one side I would have to place it unevenly on my lap and putting it in constant danger of toppling off my lapThen I discovered the Chill Pad
It really does keep the notebook cooler and I can keep it on my lap
The limiting factor is the notebook's weight that keeps me from keeping it on my lap for too longBe careful when reading the reviews
Unfortunately the reviews include reviews for different products which aren't as effective as the Chill Pad apparentlyI'm all about using accessories to enhance my gadget
This is the one accessory I use all the time
I before I got this product my HP laptop got so hot on its bottom that I couldn't touch it for more than five seconds
After buying it my computer is nice and cool even after long use on my lap
Using it is also extremely easy
It plugs into the USB port and takes very little energy from your computer so you can use it even on battery
It also comes with an on/off button so you can control its use
My suggestion if you are worried about your computer getting to hot or creating damage to your wood top desks buy it
This Podium Coolpad is made by Road Tools who supply Targus
This Podium Coolpad is great for lifting up the laptop for better viewing especially when you are using a laptop all day long
It is made of heavy duty plastic
I had the coolpad for one day and it is comfortable to use
It seems to be much better than the smaller original coolpad -- it has a wider surface and it allows for more elevation

I liked the chillmat but it doesn't blow air onto the bottom of the laptop but it sucks air and blows it out the back of the chillmat and i guess for some computers it's okay
Mine wasn't much cooler to the touch than w/out it
I guess since mine tends to get hot on the lower left where my palm rests it wasn't as nice as I would have wanted for the money
I ended up buying another cooler from Vantec lapcool2 which actually blows air onto the bottom instead of drawing air
It did a better job
I still have the targus chill pad but won't use it unless the vantec breaks down
So in my opinion for my AMD Turion 64 laptop I'd prefer the Vantec over the Targus
I bought this the other day because I was concerned about how hot my laptop was getting particularly during long sessions
With the exhaust fan on the bottom there really was not good air circulationI was delighted by how well this worked
My computer went from being noticeably warm hot underneath after about 20 minutes of use to being _cold_ after even after several hours of useThis is a flat plastic box with two small fans which runs plugs into your laptop's USB port for power
The fans are completely silent
It is easy enough to carry around - it fits in my computer bag lying under right alongside the computerOne note - this is almost the exact size and shape of the footprint of my relatively small Averatec laptop
It may not be large enough to support a larger laptop as comfortably although the cooling properties should still work fineNote I'm talking about the Targus Tornado Notebook Chill Pad
Amazon seems to be linking this review with other cooling devices which I'm not familiar with
Some seem to simply lift your laptop off of the table to allow better air circulation this one actually has fans to really cool things down
I am a long time very satisified Amazoncom customer
I recently purchased this Chill Mat manufactured by Targus
After owning it for approximately 3 weeks I noticed permanent black stains on my dining room table and coffee table where I regularly use the chill mat
The stains are a result of the little black rubber feet on the bottom of the matMy furninture is permanently damaged from using this product and I just felt the need to warn others that may be considering purchasing it
Let me start by saying that I have the Targus USB chillpad with a powered 4 port hub built into the chillpad
This seems to be slightly different than the product described here but the basics are exactly the same with exception of the USB hub built into mineThat said I have been using the Targus chillpad for about a year now and I must say that it works really well but unfortunatley I cannot vouch for its effectiveness in keeping my laptop cool
I use a program called Everest to monitor the temperature of my latop and there is really no difference between the temperature with the chillpad on or the chillpad off
The laptop is noticeably cooler to touch on the underside but the fans still kick on all the time and the temperature readings are still the same
I give this 4 stars because the product is well designed and works well but because there is no measurable difference in internal temperature I cannot give it 5 stars
It might work better for you if you constantly use your laptop on a bed or similar surface or if you actually use it on your lap
*** Plus points of the chillpad include ****- very quiet fans that move out air to the back- a handy on/off switch so you can turn it off without unplugging it from your USB- very nicely located USB ports that can be powered with the included ac wall plug useful for high power usb devices
**** Negative points include ***- slightly small size that may not work effectively for larger laptops- fans do not turn off with the laptop if you leave the ac adapter plugged in although this won't be an issue for the non USB hub model- you have to be careful about positioning your laptop if you have fans underneath so that the chillpad's fans do not interfere with the laptop's fans- the ac adapter seems a little on the cheap side
I bought this to use at home with my powerbook
I use an Antec cooling pad at my office which works very well
This cooling pad is really disappointing
The fans barely move and my powerbook's fan still has to come on to supplement
I bought this one to save 5 bucks
I should have just paid 5 bucks more for another Antec cooling pad
Don't waste your money on this one
If you own a mac laptop and looking for something to keep your machine cool when it's on the desk while making it easier on your wrists the look no furtherI was looking long and hard for a simple yet elegant device to just keep my laptop cool as in not warm
I really didn't care about ergonomics as much since the stand I was already using was so bad that anything could be an improvement
Here's what makes this device a standout1 The most important thing about this device is that it keeps the underside of your machine cool by not having any part of it touch your machine and allowing plenty of air to flow underneath
And it does it in style
This device perfectly matches the ibook colouring and blends well w/ a powerbook2 Simple device which just consists of a platform with stackable "lego" like stands that have rubber tips to keep your machine stable
It's light and can easily be packed away
It keeps your machine right where it is-no slippingnow for the whammy this is what totally bought me on this device3 it has this swivel feature that allows you to turn your machine around 360 degrees without lifting it
It seems like not a big deal but they do it so well that you will find much use
It's not loose to turn and in fact resists in such a way that you will not accidentally move it
I originally wasnt looking for this feature but considering all the other things and the fact that it is so bloody cheap compared to all the other brands I consider this a bargain
Some people will like the travel version but I dont know anything about thatAll and all this machine is definitly 5 stars
Don't consider anything else
Buy this
You wont be sorry
Good price and fast shipping
But the fan noise may lull you to sleep if you enjoy the white noise
I can't realy complain for the price was nice and the product does do what it was intended to do and I do like that it has a USB connection and you don't have to plug it into a wall outlet
I have purchased 2 of these products
Why?
The story goes like this
The first one I purchased was working fine but one day the wiring part which connects the USB wire to the chill pad became disconnected
Part of the interior mechanism was externalized
I thought I was too rough with the item so I decided to purchase another of the same item
However this second gave me constant repeat CONSTANT problem with the USB power connection
It's like those bad wiring that you have to fix the wires in a specific position otherwise there is no power to the chill pad
I had complained about this to Targus
They were pretty nice about it and gave me another USB connection cable
This one worked fine for like 2 months with maybe only once a week connection issues
However it's broken again
I don't even feel like asking Targus for another cable
This unit is highly defected
Please consider other products with more stable power supply cable
for those who are not familiar with this product the chill pad is powered through the notebook with a USB connection
I have had lots of problems with this USB connection cable since my purchase
So if you value your notebook and does NOT want it to overheat sporadically when the power cable decides to go on strike I would highly recommend other products

When we first bought this product it was great
It worked and cooled our HP notebook
The fans were a bit noisy but it did it's job
Now 3 months later the on/off switch that is on the usb doesn't work
Therefore our product doesn't work for our laptop
I had contacted the company via email with their website about their warranty
They have not gotten back to me about replacing this usb cord
Due to this issue I will never purchase another item from this company
This is a poor idea for a design with on/off switch is on the usb cord
It should have been on the mat itself
It does a good job cooling down the laptop but I use it sparingly because it's so noisy
I don't know what its dB rating is but it's certainly not like a typical PC fan
It's like five times louder than a typical PC fan
If there's a different chill pad that's quieter I'd get one
My Dell Latitude gets very hard workouts every day and runs hot most of the time
The internal fan just doesn't work adequately
The Targus fan made all the difference
Runs cool and operation of laptop has actually improved
A slightly bit noisy but not problemmatical
Next generation they should quiet them down a bit
Well worth it and highly recommended and you can't beat the price
I've got two dual core laptops at home that I remotely run virtual images on and they tend to get rather hot with the lids closed
Putting a Chill Pad under each laptop keeps both of them much cooler
I don't hear the internal fan in the laptops firing up anywhere near as much
I did have to turn the Chill Pad sideways for one of the laptops to align the fan vents with the laptop heat vents but it works fine in that configuration
If I pick the laptop up and put it back on the Chill Pad the fan inside may start to spin off balance
You have to turn it off and then spin it back up
Overall a great deal for heat venting needs
I was one of the lucky ones that got this for $1000
I will say it is well worth that priceI have owned a similar Targus before and as with this one the build quality was cheap and it only lasted several months before dying
It does help keep your computer from overheating especially if you use it in bed or other cushioned surfaces but don't expect to get years of satisfaction from this unitFor $30 or so I would expect to get at least a couple years of use
For $10 I can live with 6 - 12 months of use before it dies
Also I agree with the other reviewer that the USB connection cord is way to long for it's application
Maybe 18 inches or so would be more than adequateOn a positive note this is very useful during periods of lengthy CD/DVD burning or large file downoads for example - movie downloads or multiple TV episode downloads from iTunes
If you have Amazon Prime or qualify for super saver free shipping and can get this for $10 it's worth getting
Great item to ensure my laptop remains cool all the time
I purchased 4 and gave them to my kids along with their laptops
in reality it isn't
I have had my Chillpad for some time now
I don't take it with me so it stays in the same spot on my desk all of the time
I have had some of the same problems other reviewers had the on/off switch has fallen apart completely and the fans can be pretty loud
The product itself seems cheaply constructed and I wish the fans were moved to the back and not in the middle of the pad
With that being said the fans do help keep my laptop cool
Long story short if your laptop runs too hot this will help
I just would shop around for other alternatives first
I bought this in February and the price was 1399
I thought it was such a great deal with all the good reviews so I bought it
Well it doesn't look like the pictureit's the one with the curved sides
But that didn't really bother me
It worked great at first it was just kind of loud
Now it randomly chooses to work at all
I don't know if it's the connection or whatbut now it's merely a surface to sit the laptop onI suggest not bargain shopping on this sort of thing
-/
I bought this Chill pad and had it for about 6 months before the fans stopped working
Targus was nice enough to send me a replacement free of charge
That one worked for about 3 months before it stopped working and once again Targue send me what appeared to be a better more expensive model Not this one I'm writing the review for
I'd highly recommend looking elsewhere for a laptop cooler unless you want to be stuck having the frustration of sending it back to Targus every few months
this notebook chill pad is a great productuntil it broke about a few months later
It's not like I man-handled it either
It's was quiet and it did cool the notebook off very well but since it did stop working I have to rate this low
This unit is made of extremely cheap low-grade plastic
Less than two weeks out of the box one of the fans began to grind and make noise periodically
The upside was that Targus agreed to replace the unit the downside was that they wanted five weeks to do it
Five weeks
What am I supposed to do in the meantime?This is the first product of its type that I have owned but I was pretty shocked given its price at how flimsy it was when I took it out of the box
Since I purchased it the price has dropped drastically at least temporarily but knowing what I know now I wouldn't buy it even at the reduced price
It is just a mickey mouse device
Worked well when brand spanking new but not a long-term product
The Targus Notebook Chill Pad is trying to hold on for dear life but it sure is making a ruckus
I have a Dell inspiron 6000 that gets really really really hot to where I fell almost like I'm getting burned
Enter Chill padI can feel the air being sucked in and I can put my laptop back on my lap Pros Works as described
1 year warranty if bought newCons Well I want to say the cheap material
I'm guessing it costs Tarugus about 1 dollar to make this unit so its a bit overpriced at 2999 21 here on amazon
But this 'cheap' plastic makes it very light so it adds little weight to the laptop so it's not really a con per se
While I think it should cost about $10 less it does the job and does it wellHOWEVER
it lasted about week
After getting a replacenent that lasted 1 week as well so not that good overallget an asus cooler had 1 4 6 mos now
I'll start with the good
For its price the device does add a fair amount of circulation to the underside of your notebook
I don't recally my MacBook getting particularly hot while using this even during downloads
I'm usually wary of powering devices with my computer's battery but I didn't notice a substantial difference in battery lifeThat said the price is what it is for a reason it's cheaply built
I've only had it for a few weeks and one of the fans is making distracting noises and most of the rubber inserts have fallen out at least once and they're easy to lose
Also said inserts have a tendency to leave nice black markings on your notebook
They come off easily sure but it's still irritating
It's also not particularly comfortable on the lap if you're using it for thatPersonally I'd go for something slightly more expensive and better quality
I bought one for myself and one for my boyfriend
After having it for 3 months it totally stopped working
Such a waste of money
I orderd this chill pad in May
Didn't actually open and use it until the end of August
it has abruptly stopped working as of last night
Piece of garbage
Had this product for 3yrs before it finally quit on me
I just replace it with the Zalman NoteBook CoolerNotebook Cooler Black
This pad is light quiet and the plug is sturdy
I have owned others and the plugs were flimsy and easily short out over time with limited use
The pad is quite and light I travel with it often
I def
notice a temperature diff
when it is used
I have a 17" laptop and for anyone who has tried to buy a chill pad for a 17" laptop it is difficult to find one that really works well
Well I am happy to report that this one cools my laptop so efficiently that my laptop fan doesn't even run when the chill pad is on which was my goal in finding a chill padTargus PA248U Notebook Chill Pad
Sadly I bought this cooling fan without researching the market
It is not powerful enough and makes a loud whirring noise
My laptop is still ultra-hot the cooling pad is now just used to prop my laptop up so I can direct a mini-fan under itI contacted the company about my unhappiness towards their product and they said to bring up my issue with the store that I bought it from
Which is okay but I only realized that it was terrible after the returning period ended
I went out and buy the Targus PA248U Chill pad because my last cooling pad was a Targus that I had for long time befor it stoped working and it was agreat chill pad but this new Targus CHill pad didnt do any thing for my gateway MX6453 computer all I do on it is use the internet to watch movies and talk to friends and listen to music mmm but this chill pad was loud and didnt do any thing for my notebook computer if some one asked me if they should buy it I would say dont go look up othere chill pads/ cooling pads over all it was loud and didnt work at all does not matter how I set my note book computer on it
I have owned other Targus laptop Chill Mats and/or Pads that have worked very well for me
With the exception of this particular Chill Mat
I have been using this Chill Mat for four or five months now and have noticed that it was actually hotter using the mat than without using the mat
After comparing it with other devices I noticed one single flaw
The device pushes air upwards towards the laptop
I saw a Technology Demonstration on Youtubecom and I was using the mat in exactly same way as it was demonstrated
I have since turned the Chill Mat Upside downopposite the mat direction as orientated in the above photo
After turning the mat upside down it is now pulling the heat down away from my laptop making the laptop tremendously cooler
Either the Targus Chill Mats were improperly designed to push air upwards or I received the Mat that missed the quality check
Either way make sure the air is being pulled downwards and this device will work fantastically
I wanted to give this product Zero Stars but the Reveiw wouldn't take it so under duress I will "give" it one star even though it doesn't deserve itI got the Targus Chill Pad as part of a package deal for just over Fifty Dollars $5000 which included a wireless mouse and a pair of "stereo" speakers when I purchased a new Dell laptop
I'm sorry I paid more than fifty cents for the lot of crapBecause this reveiw is about the Chill Pad I will only say that the mouse didn't work and the speakerswell I've had cheap headphones that were WAYYY betterAbout the Chill Pad
It's junk
I think it ran the first day I got it
After that it sometimes ran but most times not
I checked it out as best I could with out taking it apart
I don't even know if you CAN take it apart it's so cheaply made it might not go back together#
I discovered that either the power cord or the socket on the back of the unit are not right
If you jiggle the end of the cord in the socket you might get it to run but as soon as you let it go the fans stop
If you are real careful you might be able to prop the cord into the socket so that it will run but that sort of defeats the purpose of having a PORTABLE laptop doesn't it?Overall the unit is made of cheap thin plastic which is poorly put together #Poor workmanship
Yes it is light as a feather and about as useful for cooling the laptop
ive had this product for almost a year now and ive had no problems until i accidently dropped it
i would definitely buy a new a one since that was obvioulsy my fault
i do suggest you clean it once in ahiwl with a gas duster to prevent dust from collecting
I've owned one of these for about 6 months now
It does the cooling function very well however The fans occasionaly get "stuck" from the very light pressure/weight of my laptop 15" dell fairly standard weight
The most irritating thing with this product is the noise
The fans create a noise ranging from a mild "hum" to a very loud and irritating "growl" from time to time
I have tried everything to quiet the fans -- tried making more space for them to reduce friction tried the "Fonzi fist bump" which will quiet them effectively for about 10 seconds tried lubricating them with silicone and nothing works
So if cooling your laptop is what you want this product does work
If you want it done without completely annoying anyone within 30 feet of you including yourself this is NOT that product for you
This product works great when using your laptop as a true laptop
My laptop would get so hot that it was uncomfortable to hold on your lap
The chill pad works great to keep the laptop from overheating
but I was so close to smashing this thing against the wall
It won't work unless you keep pushing the adapter into the cooler
good product doing good job for good pricetill the switch fall a part and then just keep twisting the wiresto keep the fans thing runninglittle detail to screw good productespecially when you forgot that the fans are not runningbecause the wires are disconnect and your notebook dyed on you somewhere in middle of your work
Excellent ProductVery pleasedVendor A++I feel I got what I paid forit was cheap and does its job of keeping my notebook coolIm glad I made the purchase
It is an effective unit that keeps one's lap and the laptop cool
It is a bit small for 17" laptops if you are sitting on a bed or a coach but otherwise it is a very useful unit
The fan noise is minimal and since it works off of the USB port it automatically shuts off when one closes the laptop lid
The Targus chill pad is very nice
It's really easy to use and protects my computer from overheating during periods of extended use
It has to be plugged in to operate though so don't freak out if it isn't functioning off the battery
The pad is necessary for using your laptop on your lap so its not bad price to pay
The manufacturer's warranty does cover the product from defects for some time if it doesn't work
We have two laptops in our household and they both have problems with overheating sometimes 1 Mac & 1 PC
We switch it out between both machines and it seems to do its job well
The results are so good that we're considering buying a second one
I bought the Targus for my husband
We had noticed that the laptop had deteriorated the table top that it sits on but didn't know what would work
I got the listing for this fan off the HP website and we are so happy
At first he didn't think it would work and it came with no directions inside
All you do is sit it down plug it into a USB port and set the switch on
It has been cool since
It is quiet and hidden
Great product
Exactly what I was looking for
It cools my 15-inch Macbook Pro just fine
It's pretty quiet my laptop fan is louder
It's not attractive but does what it's supposed to do
Haven't had any problems with it yet
I'd recommend this to anyone
I bought this item and first thing I notice is how long the usb cable is
It gets in the way when I try to also plug the power for the laptop
The second thing I notice is that it is louder than the laptop fan at its loudest
It does help cool down my graphic card hard drive and the whole bottom part of my laptop
I notice that the plastic have a cheap feel to it and would crack easily if not handled properly
Overall it was worth the money I paid for it to cool my laptop off
This product is Ok
When I had problems with a bad memory card on a 3 month old Dell computer it was recommended to me by the guy who helped diagnose the problem that the computer may be running hot and a cooling mat may help
Based on reviews and price I bought this one
I find it to be a little noisy and the height that it raises my notebook computer to is a little uncomfortable for typing but it does work - the computer fan does not come on while the Targus fan is going
It not often that you but a product that is "As Advertised"
This chill pad is an exception
The 2 fans are quiet the additional 3 USB ports are a blessing and the card reader is a great added benefit
The best part is that it all works well
My PowerBook tends to get very hot however this chill pad manages to to get the heat down to just warm
As with all products there is always something that we don't like
And the one thing that I don't like about this chill pad is that the power cord plugs into the side towards the front
I wish they had put it in the back of the pad as the did with the USB Laptop to chill pad connection
Very light therefore portable
I guess it is true that you get what you pay for - no frills does the trick but is rather loud
Add that to the noise generated by my laptop's internal fan and you've got yourself a white noise maker
I've been planning to get a higher quality fan-dock once it breaks but it has already been a year
Not sure if that's good or bad
I purchased one of these about 10 months ago
about 4 months of use it stopped working
I finally called targus and asked for a replacement
They were pretty good at doing that
So i got a new one - but less than 2 months later this one broke also
THis is not such a great investment
have to find another cooling padIf it broke once i would assume i just got one of the few bad ones
the second one broke?
my trust is lost for this brand
People This is not the Targus laptop chill pad with fans
This is the simple podium pad which lifts the back of your laptop up as high as you stack the lego pieces
You decide what angle you want to type on
It is great for cooling and wrist ergonomics
As mentioned it also swivels due to the pivot in the center of the bottom plate
I've been using one at work and home for five years
The last picture in the description is wrong - not the same unit
I have purchased two Targus Chill Mats and while I can say they both work well when they do work both of my Chill Mats have ceased to function
While the cooling tray does cool my laptop and it cools it very effectively the power switch on the Targus Chill Mat is very cheaply made and the wires have been pulled out of both units I purchased
I was able to splice the cords together and got another three month's use out of the one tray from it but for the full retail price of this tray I expected moreAlso the little rubber lift on the back of the tray have a tendency to fall off
They are loose on one unit having fallen off and been pushed back in several times and the other unit that travels with me they are just missing/lostAlso the little stoppers on the bottom of the tray that are supposed to help keep the tray from slipping have all but one fallen off tooAnother negative if you have a wide screen laptop/notebook the Targus Chill Mat is not wide enough to provide good stability for the laptop
The smaller laptops are fine but mine is a 17" widescreen and so it doesn't fit properlySo summary is it works great while it's working but it's cheaply made and for the price you could probably find a sturdier unit
My wife's laptop suffers from slow performance after a few hours of continuous operation since the fan points down not a very smart design
But after lifting the computer up with this cooling pad the problem has been resolved
My own laptop uses this cooling pad to stay cool and it has been performing like a champ for the past 4 years
In my opinion this simply cooling pad is all that a laptop needs
The more fancy ones with built-in fans are just redundant prone to failure and eats up power
Anyhow if you are looking for a cooling pad look no further this is the one to get
This pad is also thin enough to throw into your computer bag or luggage and carry with you on the road
I take mine everywhere I go
This chill pad keeps my laptop running smoothly and it doesn't heat up like it would when just sitting on the desktop or on my lap
These are invaluable and inexpensive
Thank you for bringing be a good deal
This product worked well for the first 5 months then started making loud noises
I've had it for 8 months now and the chill pad is dead
This product was smaller than I thought it would be but it seems to work fairly well - definitely keeps my computer cooler

Great company but displeased how cheaply the on/off switch was on this
Mine broke after about 3 months
They should have the switch on the base not on the powercord where it can easily brake while in a bag or something
And the fans seemed to get louder from what I can guess is losening up a bit
I love this thing - I bought the travel version and it fits in my bookbag perfectly
It works on my desk lap bed anywhere
The swivel feature makes it easy to turn your laptop if you need a different angle and the rubber feet on the top and bottom keep your laptop from slipping and keep the CoolPad from moving around on the deskEver since I bought this I've noticed an improvement in battery performance since the fans don't run as hard as well as general performance
Very much worth it
My notebook pc runs very hot and was too uncomfortable to keep on my lap while using
By using the Tornado Chill Pad with my laptop the PC stays TOTALLY cool
There isn't a hint of warmth
I think it will entend the life of the PC by keeping the hard drive from overheating
I have been using a Targus PA241U Podium Coolpad for quite a while now and it is great
I bought this Traveler Coolpad for one of my nieces since it was a bit smaller and less expensiveOne of the pieces that elevates the laptop broke off after only a couple months
She's a freshman in high school and not particularly rough with her belongingsThis was really disappointing
Next up buying her a Podium like I have
A much needed warning on this item if you are searching for a way to cool down your computer because it overheats when using intense programs this product will not stop it from overheating
This item MAY slow down the process of overheating but it will STILL happen
These "cooling pads" don't have enough power to keep your computer cooled
If your computer is suffering from too much heat and programs requiring high CPU stutter and stop this item will not help
Beware
Be warned
This Chill Mat leaves little black rings on your woodwork from the feet on the bottom
 from APC http//wwwamazoncom/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00022KJFC/ref=pd_ecc_rvi_3/103-8464419-5683020
It's a few dollars cheaper and just LOOKS a lot better than the cheesy looking Targus Podium CoolPad
So if you cut and paste the above link you can read my review there
At $2500+ this product is grossly overpriced
In terms of cooling capability it is strictly passive ie
 no fans or other cooling mechanisms and isn't even constructed of endothermic material that would draw heat away from your laptop any cooling that occurs is soley dependent upon the stray breeze that may or may not flow under your machine
The device does allow you some modicum of tilt adjustablity but only within a 1/2" to 1 3/4" range
Additionally the lego-like system used to make the tilt adjustments is cumbersome
On the plus side the swivel feature works wellThis product would be worthwhile at $1000 but at $2500 I would avoid it
After owning one for 10 months my coolpad stopped working after daily use
Definitely would not recommend
First some of the description and reviews led me to believe that the fans direct hot air out of the back and/or sides of the Chill Pad
This is not the case
The fans only blow straight through top-bottom
Second if the Chill Pad is sitting on anything -- even though the legs provide a small gap the air flow is reduced to practically nothingI bought this to put on top of my DirecTV DVR to help pull hot air away from the DVR
It actually raised the internal temperature by 2 degrees probably because the air flow it created was very minimal and it blocked some of the vented area on the top of the DVRGood idea but the implementation leaves it pretty worthless in my opinion
I bought this a few months ago and have no issues thus far
It works pretty well on my Toshiba 15" and keeps relatively cool to the touch however the pad is smaller than the computer itself
I bought this model over the powered model with the four USB ports 1 because this was cheaper and 2 I don't want to carry another power cord
There is no need to run this thing all the time only when you are using the computer for extended periods of time
Did I mention that the unit is super quiet can't tell if it is running or not
My only gripes are 1 It is cheap plastic I wonder how long this thing will last and 2 Craftsmanship this unit has the potential to fall apart so I took some gorilla glue to the seams and lastly the small size my laptop easily engulfs the unitOne note I do not play games on my laptop it is used for homework and the occasional movie
With that said this review is based on the minimal workload I put on my computer
I am sure if you play games or watch a lot of movies this might not work as well and the plastic might get hot enough to flex and eventually destroy the fans
You can have the keyboard of ur laptop in a nice height  and it makes the hot air flow but the begining part of the podium makes the air of the end of the keyboard dosent flow but perfect for my Hp Dv6000t
exact product at an affordable price w a smooth transaction
Are you tired of trying to type on a flat set of keys?
Does your laptop get so hot underneath you are sure it is gonna fry?
Well this gizmo is the item for you
Your keys are now angled to a more comfortable position
The air is able to circulate keeping your computer cooler and the palms of your hands resting on it while typingA great and simple item with purpose
The chillmat cools the laptop great
However I have had mine since 4/2006 and the cord to the USB is already shorting out on it
Which is what made me give it 2 starsIf Targus would make the cord hold up better then I would have gave it a higher rating
Now I have to wait to hear from Targus CS to see if they will replace my cord
*Edit* After writing this I had to raise the rating for this
Targus sent a new cord and it's now 9/22/11 and I still have my chillmat and the replacement cord
I use a 15 inch G4 MacBook Pro 4 to 5 times a week for about 6-7 hours a day straight
At my job if my labtop freezes or overheats and shuts down I'm royally screwed
Before using this coolpad the bottom surface of my labtop would heat up to the point where it would practically burn my fingers by the end of the day
I also noticed that files would take longer to upload and the mouse arrow would freeze occasionally due to the hardware overheatingAfter using the coolpad I noticed a significant difference with my labtops performance
It's not a life changing difference but every little bit helps
My computer never freezes or stalls when uploading files and when I touch the bottom of my labtop at the end of the day its more luke warm than boiling hot
Without a doubt the best thing about this pad has to be it's slender design and easy storage
It fits perfectly in my carry-on bag and has detable parts which make it easier to storeI must admit that the price is a slight bit high for a cooling pad
In my line of work it's definitely worth it though
And like I saidevery little bit helps
You can't go wrong with with CoolPad for 1000 the best investment I made for my laptop
It's lightweight swivels and keeps my laptop cool
I am very happy

If you own HP zd8000 then you know that it gets hot specially under the right palm
I actually had to send my HP back to factory to replace fans
I tried the Targus with two cooling fans without any difference
Following the input from users here on Amazon and some bulletin boards I gave this one a try - what a difference
Notebook still gets a bit warm but other than that its the way it should be
HP should ship this coolpad as a standard equipment with this series of notebooksEven that the coolpad looks small it hold zd8000 17 inch firmly in place
Rotating podium is also a nice feature
I actually started to like having keyboard in angle so I'm considering to buy couple of those coolpads for my desktop keyboards
Works with them too
Pros-raises laptop screen to a more comfortable level-angle of keyboard make typing easier-keeps computer off of wood desk no more marks on wood-provides for good ventilationCons-requires attention to placing laptop correctly so it's not wobbly only an issue if like me you are taking your laptop off the stand every day
really like the chill pad
Keeps my laptop cool
does its job and i would recomend it to anyoneLizzy
I have an older laptop that really gets hot when holding it on my lap bought the Chill Pad and was surprise how the two little fans work in keeping the heat factor down
It would be worth 5 stars if it was adjustable
This thing works really great only in order for me to feel like my laptop was getting maximum cooling on the bottom I took two of the pegs and super-glued them onto the wide part at the bottom using two caps with the rubber stoppers on top
I don't think it keeps the laptop cool enough without doing that
But they have stayed well and it works great now after I made that modification
It was what i spected Kinda smaller than the dimentions they specify in the decriptions but it works good
My husband's laptop was overheating constantly while he was doing his work so we bought this chill pad to help alleviate the problem
The chill pad worked nicely for about a month
The switch broke soon after and I put it back together but had to seal it closed with tape
A few months later it shorted out and hasn't worked since
It was disappointing to say the least
If you don't mind buying two or three of these a year it does work well when it's working
it worked ok for about a week maybe two then became unreliable
I have yet to find a chill pad that works well
I would not recommend spending your money on this one unless you consider your money extremely disposable
As a teacher I use my PC the entire day for my powerpoint presentations
I noticed my dell battery pack was getting very warm by the end of the day and had some concerns that the heat might be doing some damageWell I plug this cooler in it cooled down my dell in less than 2 mins run very quietly bit cheap looking with the plastic but an excellent buyOne note to be aware of is my laptop has 154 monitor and the cooler does handel it but you will need to jockey it around till you find a good balance so the PC does not flip over or fallThere are other ones that also have USB ports added in case you need more ports
This product died within 3 months
It didn't even work that good when it did work
The fans weren't very powerful and I found myself having to turn off the notebook after awhile anyway because it still got too hot
Buy the Antec
Its a bit pricier but it is very powerful and has never failed on me after almost a year
I bought this item because my laptop really gets hot
The chill pad runs off the USB port so it doesn't require an additional plug or outlet is lightweight and makes no noise at all
It's pretty cool
I had my chill pad for 1 1/2 years
It worked good for about the first 6-9 months then the fans got slower and it produced a slower and less forceful air flow away from the laptop
At 1 1/2 years it broke down
Like other people have said the wires get loose inside and you can kind of jiggle them around to get a spurt of fan movement but it will never stay going
The fans are already very weak as they are at this point
I'm very dissappointed it stopped working but it does get some credit because it did its job well while it worked
I will probably need to buy another or look into an alternate device
If you buy one be gentle with it especially the wires I kept mine wrapped in the twist tie
I've bought this product 3 different times and each time it lasted MAYBE 2 months b4 it just died
The wires alway get loose inside so it's basically just a table for my laptop
Don't buy this if you want goood value for your money
Let me state upfront that I have no problems with the product doing what it claims to do
The product worked really well for me and I was very happy with it--for a couple weeks
The switch that turns the fans on and off is very fragile and even though I never really used the switch I generally left it on After awhile of moving the unit the cords going into and out of the switch loosened and the fans quit working
For awhile I was able to push the wires in to get the fans to run but eventually even that failed
- The company does have a warranty but they didn't seem to enthused about replacing my unit
I wanted my money back not another poorly made unit
Save your money and buy a better made unit
The Targus Traveler Coolpad is probably one of the best little investments I made for my laptop
I own a Dell which can get pretty hot after working on it for several consecutive hours
I bought the Coolpad and can't live without it
It's very small and can fit in any small computer case or backpack
I even put it on my lap when working on my couch at home
Overall a great product reliable and affordable
There is no need to buy a more expensive product or a USB-powered fan in my opinion
I've had my laptop for 10 months and today after getting my Targus Tornado notebook chill pad is the first time the laptop has not been hot to the touch
My Toshiba laptop overheats often which locks it up and forces me to restart the system or get out of and back into applications to unlock everything
The Targus solved that problem completely for me
In addition I use the laptop all day for work and it is always resting on my knees or thighs which become uncomfortably hot as well
The Targus eliminated that problem for me too
The Targus is a lightweight hard-plastic platform that fits under your laptop and plugs into its USB port
It's streamlined and takes up practically no room so after you start using it you hardly know its there except for the great way it solves your overheating problems
It has two fans that emit a constant cool breeze but the fans are virtually noiseless
After several hours of using the pad the laptop is still cool and so are my knees
It's comfortable to use too
I was concerned that my laptop might slip off the pad since I generally work in a reclining position with my knees up and the laptop at an angle but the laptop stays firmly where it should thanks to the gripper surface of the pad and all I notice is much greater comfort
I can't say enough good things about this product
It's relatively inexpensive especially compared with store prices here for the same item and it works just as I hoped it would
The product is made for a 15" laptop and mine is a 17" but it still works perfectly for me
Highly recommend
The Targus PA248U Tornado Notebook Chill Pad works just fine
It works with the power supplied by the USB Port
My wife and I have been using our Targus Coolpads for the last two years while we have been travelling around the worldand working at our home office
I bought this one for a friend who just got her first notebookThis coolpad is excellent because it sets your notebook at a good angle and best of all keeps the notebook elevated off the table/surface in the event of spills etcI also like it because unlike other coolpads it's simple straightforward and packs away easily
Other coolpads we've looked at tried to do too much and were too bulky USB powered fans huge lifts etcThe targus is simple and effectiveand it's inexpensive
I have a Fujitsu Lifebook C-Series that I was unable to sit with in my lap for more than a few minutes at a time without my thighs feeling like the skin was about to peel off
This &quotChill Pad&quot has saved the day
I baught this to try on my friend's Dell Inspiron 8600 notbook
It did not help at all
Using books to lift up the back end of the notebook gave the same effect at no cost
The notebook barely fits on the device and may be the reason that the device did not work
May be this will work with small notebook
If you have a big 15&quot or up notbook look for somthing else
I bought two of these for my daughters laptops
One hasn't had a problem with her powercord at all but her laptop stays on her desk at school
The other one moves hers all over the house we have been through one power cord already Targus replaced it at no cost
I have just emailed them again to see if I can replace the cord
It is past the one-year warranty so it will be interesting to see if they will charge me
I'll keep you posted on whether it was free or how much I had to pay
Other than thatthe chill mat is great
It keeps the laptop cool and is so quiet you can't tell if it is on
Too bad they wouldn't make that on/off switch durable
I may just put electrical tape around the on/off switch and just turn it off by unplugging it from the laptop
I have a rather big Toshiba notebook 154' screen so it is about 25 inches longer than the pad
However it is still pretty stable on it and it's a lot better than using just some board to keep the computer in my lap both for my leg and the laptop which can get pretty hot in some portions on its bottomAlso 25-30 $ seems a bit pricey but not by too much for a plastic pad with two small fans in it it's not that hi-tech or innovative after all
Still it's definitely worth it since I've seen crappy no-name pads on sale for $ 15 or moreBottom line if you don't keep your notebook in your lap or it doesn't get that hot there are more useful laptop accessories you could get for this money
Otherwise it's a must
I purchased this about 8 months ago because my laptop would get so warm where my hand rests that it would almost burn
I was VERY impressed with it when I got it
I have an extended battery so the fans were able to pull the air away very nicelyIt is light weight and compact - fitting in my bag without adding too much weight or bulkLike another reviewer the cord was rather annoying long and the on off switch is not the best
I also wasn't too happy about losing out on a port but all in all have been happy with itAbout a month ago it started just turning off in the middle of my using it and now it is completely dead I can't get the fans to turn for anything
I do use it a lot more than is probably average and I don't know if it is a wiring problem or what
The picture of this unit appears to be an older model
I had the silver version and it worked well for more than two years
It had a vent in the back to channel air out
The model I replaced it with is black but still has the same PA248U model number on back and is much more dependent on airflow from underneath
This means that as soon as you place it on an sofa arm or pillow or something it will immediately start to audibly strain
However it does provide a lot of airflow when unconstrained on a table or deskBut the final straw came when one of the fan blades started making a scraping noise
I lifted my computer up to see what was happening and - I kid you not - one of the fan blades came shooting out of the unit and landed two feet to my left
This thing was pointy and sharp and could have taken an eye out - if you're lucky enough to have it come out the topI want my old silver one back
This one is being returned
great Fan and cooling have had to replace the cord twiceperhaps because I use it for hours each day
I like this cooling device and I'd have given it a five-star rating if it weren't for the fact that it has a lifespan of only about six months
I've purchased several of these over time I lose count either four or five and have had the same results every time
When it works it does a great job of keeping my laptop cool
After about six months I find the units begin to fail
Fail meaning they simply stop working period
I have not had one yet that has lasted beyond six months
I've tried one other brand and did not care for it in terms of efficiency or design so I'm sticking with the Targus till I see something else come along that seems truly better
Positives for the Targus aside from effeciency include being lightweight with nice rounded design and no rough edges and a small footprint that fits nicely in a carrying bag
I'm realizing now that I'll have to resign myself to budgeting two of these per year into my finances
It's a shame they do not last longer  they really are effective while they lastEfficiency *****Lifespan *Grand Total ***
The design of the targus product is fine but cheap electrical connections and cheap fans limit the life of this product to a few months if used regularly
It does keep the laptop sufficiently cool to alleviate overheating
The Antec mat is better for about the same price
works great laptop does not slip off keeps laptop cooler for better performance
great buy for the money from amazon similar in stores cost 2X's as much
This is a very good product and a great price I gave it to my daughter for Christmas she was very pleased
I do a good amount of gaming with the laptop on my lap
Having this does cool things down nicely
My laptop is much larger than this device which was a concern of mine but it works just fine as long as you don't forget it's there when you pickup the laptopOnly gripe is that the fans aren't protected too well but for the cost it's what you get
I purchased this item for a gift and it was exactly what my daughter wanted
Using her laptop for long periods of time it keeps it from overheating and keeps her lap from overheating when she sits using in on the sofa
I was concerned as it was sent by the supplier without any instructions for how to use it and connect it to the laptop
However my daughter knew how to hook it up
I own two of these laptop coolers
Bought at the same time and used with two different laptops
Both have the same problem
After about one month of use the socket on the cooling pad works loose so the device no longer receives power and the fans stop working
The fans do an excellent job of cooling both laptop and lap until the hardware failsIf I could figure out how to crack the case I might try to repair these devices
Instead I'm shopping for another brand with better construction
Decent for the money laptop cooling tray with two fans
Slightly noisy but so far works well for the money
I picked this up a couple of months ago and it worked decently for cooling my laptop just not great
It like many other cooling mats makes the mistake of blowing air INTO the laptop rather than drawing air away from it
This is not the way that you cool a computer effectively
Look at any desktop machine these days while some higher end machines have fans drawing cool air into the machine nearly ALL computers have fans that blow hot air out
So while this does a decent job of cooling it's far from idealMy biggest complaint is in the quality of the materials
Opening this package initially left me very disappointed as it is constructed of a very cheap and flimsy plastic
The fans are cheaply made too which I could have easily seen failing if something else didn't break firstMy biggest problem is with the power cable
It is extremely thin and fragile disappointing considering it's designed for a product that's supposed to be mobile and durable
The end of the cable that plugs into the pad itself does not fit snugly it jiggles around quite a bit and can easily come loose without realizing it
Many times I was using my laptop wondering why it was getting to hot just to realize that the cord had become unplugged without my knowledge
The USB end of the cable does not have any sort of piece to prevent the cable from being bent too far at the connector which is a certainty if you're plugging in the cable on the left hand side of your computer and judging by the unnecessarily long cable it's almost as if the designers expected you to plug in the cable there
The constant bending of the cable at the USB side caused it to be frayed within a couple of weeks leaving the wires exposed at the connectorI didn't have this pad for 2 months before the cable just snapped entirely rendering the entire pad useless
I realize that I could have been a little more careful but the fact remains that it's an unacceptably low quality product for something that's supposed to be used in a mobile setting
I will be looking for a more quality product next time around hopefully from a manufacturer that understands that laptop accessories actually need to be somewhat rugged and durable
very good price for the notebook chill pad so far so good i love it
I am not a techie nor am I computer illiterate
I'm like many of you- dependent on my computer for work and personal use just looking for something that works and doesn't cost a fortune for my notoriously hot Sony Vaio size 125" x 93"
The Targus Chillpad was the first cooler I ever bought so I was satisfied because I had nothing to compare it to until I used someone else's cooler and realized what I missing
And I immediately bought that one- $10 LESS AND 10 TIMES BETTERHere's the DealThe Targus Chillpad gets the job done
Nothing more and with SEVERAL drawbacks
FIRST it is EXTREMELY NOISY
I wouldn't recommend using it in office spaces or community areas
Also it often makes "grinding noises" when you first start it or any time you move
SECOND if you have hairy legs FORGET using the Chillpad on your lap- there is no cover on the bottom of the cooler so it will make you very nervous about those hairs getting caught in the fans AND MINE DID
THIRD the Chillpad is not as thin or compact as it could be making it difficult to pack in your computer bag
FOURTH it is extremely feeble
I remember reading about its tendency to break in other people's reviews- and they weren't joking
Mine started making those weird grinding noises within a month of getting it
A few months later the cord attaching the cooler to the computer became really loose so the chillpad wouldn't work unless I physically pushed and held the cord inside the cooler while trying to type with one hand
FIFTH the Chillpad didn't manage to cool one section of my laptop which would remain REALLY hot and I wouldn't complain about this if it weren't for the fact that the laptop cooler I recommend below does cool the entire laptopHere's the Better DealThe laptop cooler that I switched to is the Vantec Lapcool 3 about $18
It is much quieter much thinner covered on the bottom to keep those hairs safe and much more durable
I use it almost constantly and have not had a single problem excepting the noise it once made when I accidently dropped it which I think is understandable
I can't believe that a laptop cooler that is so much better than the Targus Chillpad would be so much cheaper
But that's better for me
Even if this thing were to break in the next few month for some reason the purchase would have been worth itHope this helps
This item lasted about 5 months and was a pain even during that time
It was loud when running normally and one or both of the fans would stop spinning and make some horrendous noise at random
I would have to turn it off and on again to make it work
Now it doesn't work at all
The connector used to draw power from the chord broke for no good reason as I was not hard on this cooler
Do not spend your money on this piece of crap you can get better coolers for the same amount of money
I purchased this from Staples a few months back
It worked okay but one of the fans constantly stopped working or made a horrible sound
It just stoppd working tonight
This fan was easy to setup and use
It did a great job cooling off my Thinkpad T60p
But after only a few months of fairly normal usage no drops/excessive wear/etc the power cord connection went bad - I even tried taping it into place to hold it in better but it didn't work for longAlso the plastic fins on the fan can get bent - not sure how but they do
And then they catch making that fan not work there are 2
I've gone in and fixed it - mostly by removing the bent fin
when i first got this cooler it worked fine except that it was really loud
it was really noticeable from when it was turned on and off
it did cool my laptop though so i was ok with it
after a year the plug doesnt work anymore i have to jiggle it into place and make sure it stays a certain way or else it will come out
im considering buying a brand thats surface is metal so it stays cool naturally
i dont understand why these coolers only have 2 fans that are directed toward the middle when the fans on a laptop are located on various areas of the laptop
also the cooler has small vents on the side which i think is stupid because they barely release any air
i suppose after one year i should let the cooler retire but i couldve found a similar priced quieter cooler that also has a longer life
I was reluctant at first to buy a plastic cooling pad but this one actually works quite well
I bought it specifically for the Xbox 360 to cool it down
I would recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap way to cool your laptop or as I am using it for my Xbox 360Targus PA248U Notebook Chill Pad
I bought this product as a precautionary measure for my new laptop since I had one burn out on me
It worked well for a couple months with minimal use
The first problem occured when one of the fan blades broke off while in use
I was able to shake the piece out of the way since I couldn't get the unit open and continue to use it
Soon after the power "thingy" place on the cooling pad where you plug the USB adapter in to get power became loose
I had to hold it in just the right place for it to operate
Now it doesn't operate at all and I just use it to protect my lap
I would not reccomend this product
This is the the third of these we've outfitted in our studio -- I think that speaks for itself
Best of its class
No other design is as functional and practical as this one
In addition to increasing usability the design of this riser keeps the notebook exceptionally cool
I think "cooler" would be a better word to use in describing this item
It's fairly quiet and seems to do the job of cooling not chilling
Must be used with the AC adapter or you get zip for battery lifelike you are running two fans
For the money it's perfect
My iBook G4 fits on it perfectly
I'm sure it helps to deter wear and tear on the "innereds"
I'm boycotting Targus because I contacted them about replacing my defective usb cord but they wouldn't replace it because it was "out of warranty"
What am I supposed to do with a notebook cooler w/o the cords to use it withIt sad that such a big company couldn't spare sending a measly cord to one of it's former customersI have not and will not be buying anymore of their products
We've owned this particular model for a week now and I've go tot say no complaints knock on wood
We had that white plastic piece of crap thing from Belkin and the leg broke off after 2 months of use so when we purchased a new laptop last week and bought this new pad along with itIt has no leg to break off and is a really great design
If you have it on your lap I'd reccomend parting your legs a bit so tha tit can get air from below to cool the computer
It's very quiet the USB cord is long enough to accomodate the USB supply that might be on the sides of the computer as opposed to the back
All in all very happy with this purchase thus farway to go Targus
the chill pad was thicker and louder than i expected
i also did not notice any heat difference in my laptop
ive seen better products out there for around the same price
i ended up returning mine
This is a great inexpensive quiet way to keep your notebook running cooler
It plugs into a USB port and runs silently and efficiently
Highly recommend this chill pad
I purchased this chill pad on March 28threceived it in April and it died in June
It died after the initial 30 days so I can't return it to Amazon
Don't waste your time or money
I am very dissapointed with this fan it worked great for a few months then it broke down I had it replaced then it broke down again it was then replaced a second time and now it has broken down yet again
Customer service at targus is great however to replace it each time is $5 pay for shipping and at this rate I have spent as much as a more durable one would have cost meProswhen it is working properly it keeps your laptop very coolCons-It is flimsy I don't recommend it for laptops over 5 lbs-The cable is what has been breaking down on me so its obviously cheap-The rubbers fall off that hold the notebook up at an angle-it is made of very cheap plasticLike I said its good when its working but dont expect this to last you over a year
The item I received was black and looks a "tad" different but it serves its purpose well
A little noisy but the price was right
Bought it at $1499 Lightening Deal offer
First the pictures shown on the amazon web page are of a different model the model I received and the model shown on the Targus website for this model number  dont have those grooves that you see on the pictures shown on the product page
But the rest of the item is the same with 2 fans the usb port the power switch etcI have been using this for the past 2 days and I find that this is an excellent product for the price
I have a 17 inch laptop and I often work with it on my bed late into the night or on the patio with the laptop on my lap
I have had my laptop really heat up my lap making it very uncomfortable indeed
This chill pad has powerful enough laps and very quiet
I had my reservations on some of the reviews that spoke about the noise but there is literally none except a very low hum
After a while unless you are listening hard for it you wont even realise itDont really know about the power consumption coz I often keep my laptop plugged in when I am working and remove the plug only when I need do
But I havent seen any appreciable depreciation hmmm "appreciable depreciation" is that an oxymoron ?
  in the battery life4 stars because I would have liked Targus engineers to consider 17 inch laptops while designing this maybe have a couple of retractable slots on either side that would extend out when needed and slide back into the main body for smaller laptops?
That way those slots could even serve as maybe mouse pads for smaller laptops ?
the pad is rather small for my 17 inch laptop extends about an inch on either sidebut besides that I find it an excellent productDefinitely recommended
I'm on my second one of these
After a few months the connection comes loose and I have to wiggle it around to get it to work
Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't
When it does the computer runs cooler
I bought the new model thinking it would be more sturdy than the old model but it wasn't
It lasted an even shorter time before it developed this problem
It's a good idea that still needs working on
I bought this item originally from Wal-Mart
This is my FOURTH one in a little over a year
Every one I have had has died within 4 months
So I just kept either exchanging it for a new one or buy a new one and return the broken one
Then it looked like Targus redesigned the PA248U because even though the model number was the same they changed the casing completely and added an on/off button
I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt so I got it
It was improved
Now it doesn't die outright
The fans will just stall out until you move the mat around and angle it up until the fans will restart
And to get warranty service you have to pay to ship it back to them
But it costs over half as much to do that as it does to buy a brand new unit
I received a targus chill pad that was different from the one being shown by the seller
seller needs to update the image
chill mate cools the laptop but it is noisy
the fan noise can become annoying over time
I would not recommend this model
This products is not recommended for PC 15 inch the service for Amazon is Good Thank you
I bought a POS laptop from Circuit City for college
It had severe overheating problems and Circuit City wanted to take 30% of the purchase price as a restocking fee which I couldn't afford
So I kept the awful bottom of the line Averatec brand laptop
Never heard of it?
Didn't think so
There's a reason
I purchased the Targus branded cooler after my Antec one died it is of slightly better quality than the Antec though not by much
I waited until after the Antec died because the Targus branded cooler was more expensiveAmazon has a great price on both the Antec and the Targus $12
When I needed the cooler in college usually on an emergency basis I had to rush out to Best Buy and sink $25-30 for the Antec or $40-50 for the Targus
So you can see why $12 is a bargain to meThe Antec and the Targus both have a life expectancy of one year in my experience if you get a dud it can be less FYI Targus has a good warranty and will be helpful in making an exchange of your dud for a working coolerIf you've already sunk your money in a craptascular laptop then a cooler might be a good idea
If you haven't purchased your laptop yet you might consider buying a laptop without an overheating problem
Or at least don't buy your laptop from Circuit City
I've had this for about 6 months or so
A couple of months ago I noticed that my laptop wasn't cooling down anymore and that's when I realized the USB wire was disconnecting and therefore preventing the chillpad from turning on
To work around the issue I would have to fidget with the cable so that the unit would actually turn on
Well today it finally died
$20 is not a lot of money but it sure is a waste if the product only works for a few months
I was nervous about getting a chill pad
My friend has owned several because she said they broke frequently and had to be replaced
I have had my chill pad for over a year now and couldn't be happier
Other than the fans being a tad rattly from frequent use it's a great product
It helps divert the heat from my laptop and keeps my lap nice and coolI RECOMMEND this product
i really like this little fan
my computer has had no distortion at all since i began using this
i also bought one for my daughter
Just look nice and really help me a little bit in cooling down with HP notebook
My notebook is hot all the time and even dead in winter from time to time
With this chill pad I cannot say it completely cools down but is never dead again
I almost never write negative reviews but have to for this product
After three weeks the fan started making noise
The pad has been sitting on my desk I don't carry or use it otherwise so it hasn't been knocked around
I do use my laptop MBP very long hours but that's why I purchased the product in the first place to keep my laptop cool
It appears that the fan blades are now hitting another part of the unit the grating?
 slowing them down and making an intolerable amount of noise making the product unusableAfter I unplugging the power jack several times it also became very difficult to plug back in
The power jack is also defective
I'm going to return the product
Very poor quality design and fabrication
Stay away from this product
Reflects poorly on Targus too
Feel very comfortable using it
Very light and well builtProvides bushes for height adjustment for Laptops such as 17'' ones
Freely dissipates the heat generated by laptop by natural flow of airGood angle to typeMust buy for any laptop size especially for 15 or higherThank youAditya Maturi
Less than two months after purchasing this product it did not work properly
So I contacted the seller after reading their guarantee"A-to-z GuaranteeWe want you to buy with confidence anytime you purchase products on Amazoncom
That is why we guarantee purchases from Amazon Marketplace Auctions zShops and Merchant sellers
The condition of the item you buy and its timely delivery are guaranteed"After providing all the information they requested they said they were very sorry but I had to contact the manufacturer
The item was less than $20 and by the time I would go through the hoops I would have spent another $20
This really is aggravating because of their stated guarantee
My belief is that if a seller does not act positively I will not beat my head against a wall
Rather I will write a review and hope no one else gets stuck with this problemThis is only the second negative review I have written in all my shopping with Amazon
And they both have happened in the past month
I always rate my transactions and as a whole have not been disappointed with my purchases on Amazon
I had this product for about three days before realizing I should have bought something else
The cord on it is way too long and there are no additional usb ports so it was taking up one of the only four I had
After about four months the fans just died they just don't work anymore
I have taken the cord off and use the base just to keep it off a flat surface until I get a better one
Not to mention it seems really flimsy and if the fans would have lasted any time at all then it probably would have broken somewhere else
I bought this product for the second time based on the low price however as the saying goes "You get what you paid for"
Which is absolutely true for a second time buyer
It worked fine for a while but as time goes the fan blades begin to get caught in the grill and make a very loud sound and eventually they break offBut I paid under $11 for it so I got what I paid forI invested alittle more in another brand and it is holding up thus far
I've had this item for a few short months and I had to throw it away
After a month the fans operated intermittantly and I had to fiddle with the wire awhile until I got fed up
I found after opening the unit that the plug for the power USB cable had one of the three connectors that is solder to the board was broken off
Very disappointed that the build of this pad was very flimsy
Not worth more than a couple of bucks
Maybe 50 cents
Seriously if you need a hardy long lasting cooling pad for your laptop look elsewhere
Targus missed the mark with this one
I would not recommend anyone to buy this product
The plastic blades which make up the fans starting breaking after two weeks
Then after another 2 to 3 weeks the cord started not to work without me wiggling it around
Then it just stop working altogether
Do Not Waste Your $$$

This product fixed the issue I had with my laptop's fan upon first use
Often when I am running the processor hard I hear the fan kick into high gear however I no longer hear the computer's fan and the product's two fans are very quiet
I wish I didn't wait this long to purchase it
I bought this item under great suspicion
My laptop is a Dell inspiron 5100 and it's cooling system is a piece of garbage
I have already had to send my system in once but now that it is out of warranty I am looking for a new solution to my new trashy cooling system
This product helped dramatically
My computer is much cooler the fan does not go on for nearly as long or as loud and this product does not affect the useability at all
I would highly recommend this item
I like this product so much that I just bought a spare so that I don't have to carry it back and forth -- I almost never use my laptop without it
For me the biggies are the greatly improved typing position and that it brings the screen nearly up to eye level where it belongs
I use it with the maximum rear elevation and wish it had one more set of risersThat it allows better airflow and swivels are extra bennies but not my main reason for liking itThe latest model comes with an extra bar to put on top of the risers for additional stability
That's not shown in the photo as of this writingEdward-- I see the brevity of truth

Bought this online from eforcecity
It's a nice powerful fan if you have a really hot laptop
Unfortunately within a day of getting it pieces of the fan began breaking off
Then 3 and a half months later the connection that powers the fan from the computer broke off
Just like the other negative reviews after a few months I had to wiggle the cord a LOT to make the fans turn on
And not long after that it just stopped workingIt's really a terrible product
It's made of plastic so that doesnt help disperse the heatOn a side note I've also bought a Targus laptop briefcase and the locks to keep it securely shut are starting to become unaligned after only minimal useI'd stay away from all Targus products all together
This does help cool the laptop but the fans seem to get loud after only a couple of months of use
As others have said the cord is too long and gets in the way
I've used another product at a friend's house that I like better -- it doesn't cool the computer as much but it is much quieter and the cord is nice and shortBecause of the noise I do use the on/off switch
When the computer is getting warm I turn the fan on until it cools off or I get tired of the noise whichever comes firstI'll keep using this for now but when and if the switch breaks I certainly won't buy another model from Targus
I got my targus Tornado a week ago from Amazon
Amazon shipped it real fast
I think it is a must for all laptops
It drastically reduced the heat from the bottom of my laptop
Its so convenient
I use a dell Inspiron 9300 which usually generates a lot of heat
After using this I dont have to worry about the heat even during playing high end 3d games
I surely recommend
I was having trouble with my Toshiba P15-S479 overheating during the use of some CD based software
The computer would just shut off
I got this CoolPad and not only does the computer not shut down it is cool to the touch all the time
I am sure that this will extend the life of my laptop
A small price to pay for my investment
I'm using this for my SONY VAIO  solved the problem of overheating to a great extent
I strictly recommend this if you leave your laptop switched on for long hours  but the quality of plastic with which it is made is not so good  and so are the binders which keep the fans fixed  my chill pad makes some noise as one of the fans got displaced probably  i'm not sure 
I have owned multiple laptops with the latest being a Dell Inspiron 8500
When I first purchased the Dell it gave me no problems while gaming database processing or while I did high-end graphic development
I even upgraded to 2GB of DDR RAM but as soon as I tried to watch some long DVD's the laptop started crying for helpAfter some different ideas I felt like giving this a shot and I am so glad I did
It was very inexpensive and worked like a champIf there was one thing I would do differently I would NOT plan to pick-up the item at Circuit City as I did with this item
It was such a difficult time there and I will make all purchases solely through amazoncom from this point forward without a Third Party
The main use of the coolpad is to be used as a platform
It gives a good grip and is quite stable even for big notebooks mine is a 154"
To be able to rotate the notebook is a nice improvment if it is on your desk but it is too small to use in the lap
Very light and portable
It cools just a bit so don't buy if you have overheating problems
Look for one of those pads with fans
Also make sure you do want your notebook a bit lifted
Finally it could definitely be cheaper
Nice construction but still just a piece of plastic
The pad cools better than nothing but the chord that connects to your laptop is terrible
I've gone through at least 4 of them over the last year
Consistently the part of the cable that connects from the cool pad to the on/off switch has a break in it
All I do is wrap up the cable put it in my bag and otherwise use the device on my lap
I'm not sure how to limit its exposure much more
Only good thing is Targus will replace the cable for you but it takes a few weeks to receiveAlso the rubber nubs that hold the laptop in place are often lost with no replacements readily available
I'm looking for a better product at this time
Ok  so here is the low down on this product
Its loud I would take my laptop to school and people would thing my laptop was going to explode from the sound of this thing
I didn't mind it but it bothered most people
I will say that the fans did increase performance slightly since the computer was running at a lower temperature
Right now I am looking into getting the chillhub to replace this item
I think any laptop owner should buy some kind of extra fan for their notebook
Down side to using the chill pad is the fact that you lose a USB port but it's great for travel
I kept mine taped to the laptop so that it wouldn't slide or anything and kept the super long cable taped to the lid of my laptop
After about 9 month it just broke the fan tore itself up then it started grinding now its scraps to me
Oh yeah another good thing about this is that is lifts your notebook up and makes it easier to type when it's on a table or at least that's how it is for me I get a better angle on my wrists 
This cooler is too small for any regular sized notebook
Its also very flimsy the one I have broke withen a few months
Not worth the money
I bought this product from amazonSince I bought this one my laptop did not crash even once due to heating
It powers thru USB which was good for meOnly reason why I did not give this 5 stars was that it makes some kind of noise when its running which sometimes irritates me especially during the night
The PodiumPad by Road Tools rebranded as Targus is the big sibling of Coolpad
Basically it just has adjustable rubber balls as opposed to fixed ones on the Coolpad
Neither one works at all when it comes down to cooling down your laptop computer
It's also very inconvenient to type on the laptop when placed on the Podiumpad and adjusting the height of the rubber thingies is a pain
Do not waste your money
Search for a product called Bytecc Notebook Cooler which is cheaper and has built-in fans which actually cool down your computer
I'm running a Dell Inspiron 9100 - one of their first models to have a Pentium 4 HT processor
Because of this fact my computer gets incredibly hot on its underside right below where the memory and video card is installedI bought this pad hoping it would help - but the truth is I can't tell if it helps or not
The two fans on this thing while quiet seem very weak
I can barely feel any extra air coming from the back of my system and the area where the memory is installed still gets intensly hot
It DOES elevate the computer off of whatever surface I'm working on which is good I suppose but my laptop is so large widescreen display that it completely covers the Chill Pad and sometimes slides off of itI want to give this thing a good review since my computer needs its help so badly but it just feels underpowered and flimsy
I doubt this thing will last more than a year and it's not really worth blocking up a USB port which is annoying considering I work in media and need all the ports
Perhaps the newer model of this Chill Pad with the built-in USB hub works better and is better constructed - if so get that one
This one works in the sense that the fans do indeed spin but that's about all I can say for itAnd to top all that when I pulled mine out of its box it already had a crack in the plastic and some of the silver paint was rubbed off the corners
I was hoping this product would make my HP Pavilion ze5300 quieter the fan runs full speed ALL the timesounds like a leaf blower
The fan is still running full steam ahead but the bottom of the laptop does not feel as hot as it use to
It must be working
I used this product to cool my laptop which is a server
Therefore I ran this notebook cooler for 24 hours a day
After running it for 3 months I realized that one of the fan slowed down
A month later the fan stopped runningOverall I don't recommend this product
The cooling power is not strong enough especially yours is a heavy duty laptop
I recommend the one from AntecAntec USB-Powered Notebook Cooler
I've run mine for 2 years non-stop
So far it still works great
This worked great for two weeks and then just stopped working
I fiddled with the cord and it started again
Then it stopped and completely died
Don't buy this it is something about the connection cord that is defective and quits working
If there was a way to rate it at zero stars I would
This product is cheaply made and noisy
The USB power cable developed a problem after 30 days
Don't get ripped off
Avoid this unreliable product
For $11 it's what I expected
It elevates my laptop so there's room for the heat to get away
It's a little small for my 15 inch laptop but it'll work
The base swivels which is nice and makes it easier to adjust the angle of the laptop screen
I have used this item for my deployment in Iraq
I was scared about my laptop over heating that I purchased this item without completely reviewing the durability
I can now tell you that this item works great under hottest weather condition
The chill pad worked great for my HP Pavilion that had been overheating on a regular basis
Then one day the fans stopped running and the on/off switch didn't work
My husband a mechanical engineer determined that the problem was that there was a break in the metal wires
I think I'm going to try another model that doesn't involve mechanical parts
Neither my Apple PowerBook G4 121" nor iBook G3 141" gets insanely hot but I thought it was a good idea to protect them from overheating anyway
Besides the bonus of being able to swivel the computer easily when at my desk and protect it from spills I work in a lab with lots of liquids around made this a worthy purchase
The first one stopped working for no apparent reason after about one year
The second one is way too noisy
This means that the third one will definitely be a different brand
Too bad as this model is cheap lightweight and it does the job as long as it works
Wasting money on things is alright wasting money on the Targus Chill Pad is NOT acceptable
There are WAY better options for a notebook cooler's such as the Cooler Masters NotePal U-x series which will run you about 5 more bucks
I've used it on my aging HP Pavilion Dv5 notebook which is apparently notorious for turning off when overheating these were the results-Turned on my computer without the cooler
Watched some videos for 15 minutes
Turns off-Let the computer cool off
Turned it on
Plugged in the Targus Chill Pad
Watched some videos for 25 minutes
Turns offWow
An extra 10 minutes of Dexter
No
The cooler doesn't evenly distribute air plastic quality is of no help and the usb cord broke in about a week
Not ever buying again
Only good thing about it is the price
But the price isn't worth a Chill Pad that'll break by week two
I used mine for six-eight hours a day and it broke a little after two weeks
It'll still work I just have to fight it
Move the USB Cord around a lot position it differently
It's just too much of a hassle to be worth the price
If you're looking for a cheap Chill Pad this is it
But if you're looking for a Chill Pad that works this isn't what you want
Don't expect this item to "cool" down your laptop
It's just good enough to put it between your lap and the computer
Check for the dimentions of your laptop before buying
This is a nice notebook cooler for my HP Z2000but it's made of cheap plastic
Since I bought this coolpad my Dell and Toshiba have had no more overheating problems and are never hot to the touch anymore
Further neither sounds like a wheezing horse since the fan barely needs to run now
Games and programs that take up a lot of system resources don't hang up or run slowly anymore
You already spent $1000 or more on a laptop there's no reason NOT to buy the Coolpad to protect your investment
I use a super hot Sony Vaio laptop w/a 17" screen
Since it's a Pentium 4 it runs very hot
A couple of months ago my laptop started shutting down on its own
This would happen after a few hours
I bought the Targus Chill Pad a couple of months ago to help keep it cool but I also used compressed air to clean out the laptop's fan and chamber first
The laptop has been fine ever since even having it on 7 hours or more
To the touch the Vaio feels much cooler than before
So I think the Chill Pad has helped but cleaning out the dust has as well
I agree the unit is rather cheaply made but I rarely move it around since my laptop is too heavy
I recommend this product but suggest you remove any dust in the laptop to get maximum benefit from this product
This chill pad worked for about 2 months before I ran into problems
I found that I had to wiggle the power cord where it plugged into the chill mat on the side in order for the fans to come on
Within a week I couldn't get power to flow to the chill mat at all
Works great
My Dell notebook used to overheat all the time but now I canwork without interruptions
I am extremely satisfied
I happen to own a Mac Book Pro which runs pretty hot
I saw this on Amazon and read the reviews along with all of the other cool pads for laptops and wound up deciding on this one largly because of the lack of negative reviews and Amazon said most people buy this cool pad
Let me detail for you why this is a horrible purchase $20 or otherwiseFirst off it really wasnt clear from the description or pictures but this chill pad is plastic
It disperses little to no heat where as propping the back of my laptop up with a book did better
I was hoping for a metal that would act like a heat sink is that not the purpose of a cool pad?
The laptop is far to close to the actual chill pad so there is little to no air flow and since the piece is plastic you will have to keep the fan on for any effect
Unlike Antec or NotePal coolersThe usb wire is long and for some reason has an on off switch on it
Why you would plug in the usb cord yet keep it the fan off is beyond me just an annoyance no real issue with performanceI am a programmer so I already spend a long time at the keyboard
This cool pad raises your laptop up higher then its competitors as listed on Amazon virtually breaking your wrists to type on it
However if you dream of altering your desk and chair and possibly buying a bunch of other garbage to raise your wrists for typing this may not be an issueMy last gripe is how cheaply made this product is
Being plastic with little to no design it is an eye sore and you may just break it or the fan by using itOverall using this is a far worse experience then just using the laptop hot as it only reduces the temperature by three degrees
I guess I was looking for something that was a little more comfortable and practical to work on
As well as effective
If you buy this you will be underwhelmed
The cooler is a help but no shortage of heat still produced
It's smaller than the laptop as expected but not by much dell 1705
I am using my laptop on my legs and I was afraid of the consequencesI am very with the product1
looks and feel solid2
very quit3
cool the computer
I should have checked here first too
I bought this through Officemax less than a year ago and it worked well while it worked but after less than a year it's now dead
For $in plastic and motors I expect better than a one year obsolescence
I won't be buying this brand again
Well the unit operates
But as you can expect it does not have much air flow
And the fans blow down and out the back or front depending on how you place it
My computer Toshiba Satellite wants the air to go UP from below not down
So I could not use the Tornado on my lap
I can use it on a desk and prop my laptop on the exit side
But the bottom line is that it did me no good
In the end the solution to my laptop overheating was to take my home vacuum and suck the lint back out through the fans
It runs cool as a cucumber nowGood Luck
Since purchasing this cool mat I hear my laptop's internal cooling fan running way fewer times thus maintaining the life of my laptop
Every laptop owner should have a cool mat with fans
This product in particular is reliable trouble-free and well designed
This design secures and cradles my laptop while allowing it tremendous ventilation
I should have bought this years ago
I have a fairly high powered HP Pavilion laptop with 17 inch screen
Gaming or anything else that was processor intensive would CONSTANTLY cause my machine to shut down due to overheating
Ever since I've used the Chill Pad - I haven't had ANY issues
It connects directly to the PC's USB port - very convenientGreat product
Mine did help keep my Dell Inspiron 8500 from getting too hot but the USB cable leaves a lot to be desired
About a month after getting mine the fans stopped working
I found the problem to be in the silly on/off switch they stuck in the middle of the cable
I removed the switch and spliced the cable
However now approximately six months after I bought the unit it appears that a wire has broken near the USB plug and as far as I know replacement USB plugs aren't available
I guess now it's buy a 5V AC adaptor and wire into the thing
Needless to say I'm not impressed
The pad works just as described the only thing I have had trouble with is the power connection on the pad
When you attempt to remove the cord from the pad it pulls the entire unit power cord assembly out
Otherwise great
got it and used it the result is not as good as others said
it is ok product but not great
This is my second purchase of this chill pad
The first one I had bought and used for a year before the USB cable cord somehow couldn't work anymore
I then bought this second one played around with a few combinations between the old and new pads and found out that the problem lay in the cord
The new cord works with the old pad so I'm guessing that a wire in the cord got loose?
So if you pad doesn't work anymore just try to find a cord that is comaptible with the pad instead of buying the pad again
Anyways I think I've said the word "cord" too many times in this review
I just bought this today at an Office Depot
I was concerned that it may be loud and/or bulky
However my laptop's fan is not running nearly as much as it was prior to plugging in the chill pad
Also just by simply touching my laptop I can tell that the temperature has decreased significantly
That was the main reason for purchasing thisI love my laptop but it was getting so hot that I could barely stand to type for any extended period of time
Sotemp down and very quiet
It is much quieter than just the normal laptop fan
Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anyone having issues with a too hot laptop
Light and comfortable to use keeps the heat of your laps and also reduces the temperature of your laptop as you can feel that the computer fans do not come on as often as they did
Side power cable can be a nuisance sometimes and in my opinion if Targus had routed the connections on the back than on the sides it would be better
For ~$20 you can't go wrong with this
I always hated how hot my laptop would get after working for awhile but this really helps
I would give it 5 stars if it tilted to make typing a little more comfortable but it's slim so not a big deal
This device is an addition to the fan inside the notebook
However by itself'vfv\ it did little to cool the laptop down
I have gotten 2 of these from Targus only to have them both break right at the switch
The switch is so flimsey next time I'm going to go with a different model
I would have expected better from Targus
It does what it says it's suppose to
The fan on my laptop goes on lees often when I use the cooler so that's good
This product did not work properly with my newer Macbook Pro
My computer just slipped right off the supposedly sticky rubber grips
It claims to work with all Macs so beware if you have a Pro or Powerbook
I think the finish on them does not work well with the product
I gave the CoolPad to my boyfriend for use with his Macbook and it works wonderfully with that laptop
It seems very secure and it's been sitting there for weeks
The Targus Coolpad definitely keeps the laptop cooler as well as the surface it is sitting on including your lap
The laptop does have a tendency to slip forward especially when sitting on your lap but that can be fixed by wiping the rubber props with a damp cloth from time to time
I would recommend them to others
What a great price for a great product
This Pad is so quite that I'm always checking to make sure it hasn't stopped working
It's a little small for my machine but still keeps it from overheating
I bought the Chill Pad because of the good reviews and loved it for the time that it worked
However here I sit 6 months later with a dead chill pad
I can't say I was especially tough on it either as it was never dropped and never left the house
Also I felt the top was a little flimsy as the weight of my laptop actually caused the top of the chill pad to grind against the fan blades once in awhile
I'm going shopping for a replacement but I think I will try something else this next time
I bought this when it came out it was very expensive and it broke within 2 months
Very terrible quality do not buy
I've been using this product for about two weeks and am satisfied with it so far
It's very quiet and small enough to easily fit in the case with my 15" laptop
It works great on carpet or in bed where my computer used to overheat
I was hoping my laptops's noisy fans wouldn't have to run when I'm using the chillpad but they still do even on hard surfaces
The chillpad takes up one of the two USB ports on my laptop but that's not usually a problem for me and it's more convenient than plugging into an outlet
I purchased this cooling device for my big-honkin' HP Pavilion 16" laptop because there were times when my laptop was literally too hot to touch
I'm not sure if the device has actually helped extend the life of my PC but I feel much better about letting it run constantly
In any case I think a cooling pad is an excellent investment especially if you have a laptop that doesn't cool itself particularly wellHowever I have to give the Targus Chill Pad a 'C' because I've only had it 5 months now and it seems like it's ready to break
For the most part it just sits on my desk under my laptop
I don't move it terribly often except when I travel once a month
As I write this review the chill pad's cooling fans are making a pretty healthy racket
Mind you it wasn't always like this -- when the pad was new it was almost silent
But as time has gone by the fans have gotten progressively louder
Now I'm concerned the cooling fans will soon fail because the left one will occasionally sound like my blender
A quick tap on the top of the fan seems to fix it but it's happening more and more oftenFor $20 it's hard to expect something that will last forever
However I think the lifetime should be longer than 5 or 6 months
Good idea poor execution
I use my laptop an older HP G60 about 14-16 hours a day and heat build up is a serious issue
I was quite surprised to find that this pad died in just over 6 weeks
Usually Targus items take the daily beating I put them through and come back begging for more
Not this one
It worked fine for about six weeks
Yesterday I forgot to shut off my laptop over night
I got up this morning to a dead fan and my laptop shut off because it overheated
I will go look for a different model today and avoid this one in the future
Great Product
Works well
My laptop tends to run hot but this chill pad really works
No more cutting off due to overheating
The good  it does the job provides cooling as expected for this price range productThe bad  Exceptionally noisy
I just installed Cooler Master and I thought it was broken because I could not hear it
Targus was running like a motorcycleInferior quality
The left fan is malfunctioning smell of burning PVC
Unfortunately out of warranty
If you can afford an expensive laptop worth cooling you can afford a better cooling padLet me put this piece of junk into the garbage bag
The air flow from the two fans is barely noticeable even half an inch from themAnd flow is in the opposite direction of what I would expectIe
the air is sucked in from the top and pushed out along a longnarrow strip on the long thin side
This causes the laptop to getas hot as it normally would without the chill pad
And I suspect thelow pressure caused by the suction at the top may reduce cooling airflowinto the laptops most of which have opening at the bottom to suck in airI would expect the fans to push air up to the laptop sitting on top of itThere is no way to reverse the flow and the fans are not removable fromthe case as the case moulding forms the fan axleTotal waste of money other than to see how cheaply todays products are made
I brought it because I needed it but the complaints about the openings being to much in the center is an issue
I remedy the situation by off setting the laptop off the fan to where one of the fans blew into the side where the laptop fan opening is located
The fan started off great but it stopped working the cord has some type of shortage
Many times I have to plug the cord in order for the fan to move
Sometimes one fan would be moving while the other was still
Upside it is cheap downside it will stop working and you would have wasted money on it
I would recommend this to a friend
this chill pad was the cheapest and best decently rated chill pad I could find for my laptop
I got this for less than $7 and its definitely worth it
It does it's job and keeps my laptop quite cool even keeping my lap a little cool too
I was worried about this being relatively loud but the first time I turned it on I wasn't even sure it was on there was no sound or obnoxious vibrations and I have no complaints about this
The only slight annoyance is that it is a little cumbersome to bring anywhere school work etc
but for home use in bed on the couch etc
I couldn't be happier
Definitely worth the cheap price
This product if ordered should just go straight to trash can
Fans are in the center which does absolutely nothing for my computer
Second the fans are small so no air is circulated by these things
Worst fan I have ever purchasedFinally purchased a large single fan that works and works well
Stay Away from this Piece of $***
You figure it out
I bought this from a vender at a discount event because I needed a cooling pad
At the time I thought it's light weight meant that it would be great for transporting not that it was flimsy and cheaply-made which it was
I must have used it less than ten times
I tend to use my laptop all over the house so carrying the cooling pad with me wherever I went was a burden and I'd only gotten it to shut my computer up over complaining about overheating
When my laptop was on my lap it tended to overheat less but it still did not cool it that much so I used the cooling pad whenever it was sitting on my bed or table
I just tried to plug it in today when it refused to start after not having used it for several months
The pad had been propped up against my bookcase in the interim nothing extreme like having it in my backpack every day
Nonetheless it is broken and I feel gypped out the $16 I paid for it
It came with a one-year warranty but frankly I'm so dissatisfied that I don't even want another piece of Targus "quality merchandise"I will write this professionally though and give the pros and consPros-lightweight-has rubber pads-easy to useCons-cheaply manufactured-frequently started and stopped-broke within 6 months-did not cool my laptop significantly-noisyWarning do NOT buy Targus brand laptop accessories
The low price is more than that you actually get something that will last less than a year without frequent use
I had another coolplate i bought in the store for way more that burnt out in a few weeks not the same brand i've been using this one for over a month now my computer isn't heating up and you can feel it cooling its honestly worth the money shipped really fastI have since bought a new laptop so now we have two and now i have purchased my second one Luv this chill pad its well worth the cost and way cheaper then in the stores
In addition to this item I also own the "Laptop Notebook Cooler Pad w/ 3 Fans" that's about the same price as this and the "Antec USB-Powered Notebook Cooler" that's currently about triple the price
I place them under stereo equipment that has problems with overheating
Unlike the other two units this pad sucks air from the top of the unit and then blows it out the back
This is less effective than blowing up and through my units and they are noticeably hotter with this unit than with either of the others
However if your laptop fan blows down this unit might work for you by pulling away the air the fan is blowing out
The pad ran quietly but 2 years later it is missing 5 of the foot pads and the fans no longer run
For something with hardly anything to it that's sad
It works well very quiet but for the price you can buy one with three fans and light indicator op power
This was a great cooler out of the box it is silent and cooled nicely
However it's cheaply made
The power cords are very cheap and the cooler itself is flemsy plastic
The pictures make it look much more substantial than it actually is
Our quit working after about 3 months
Targus makes a "new & improved" version
We tried it as well
Much better made but it was noisey so noisey it gave me a headache
So we opted for another brand and much happier
I've owned this product for less than 5 months
The fan operation has been erratic the last month
Today it quit completely
I expected more from this product than it delivered
I will not buy another Targus product
Inexpensive should not mean cheap
This Targus did a great job keeping my notebook cool
Unfortunately it died for no apparent reason after only 5 months of use
It never left my home
I kept it in my laptop backpack and babied it as I do all my computer equipment
It looks brand new too bad it's a useless piece o' crap
Shame on Targus I specifically bought it for the Targus name thinking it would be dependable
What a waste of money
I bought this product for a 13" notebook
I could see virtually no improvement in the heat reduction performance of the 2 fans
I was disappointed with the lack of quality in this product and turned off by its design and cheap plastic appearance
It did not appear to be constructed with any lasting longevity in mind
On that note I promptly returned it for a refund and purchased an aluminum frame Cool Master Note Pal
It has definately cooled down my computer and has been a good choice
Good item to help keep your lap top from getting too hot
A necessity for lap top computers
This podium is very nice
I have hp pavillion notebook 17" and it fits very well
This product doesn't have any external cooling system
I bought not one but two chill mats for household computersNeither one lasted more than two months
The connection plug from the USB port to the mat broke down in both instances
While the connection plug worked it was fine but this is a serious issue with the productI discourage buying this chill pad
great if you're looking for a low-cost solution
I bought this because my laptop gets hot and burns my wrists i read the reviwes on amazon and i went ahead a got it it works wonders my laptop never gets hot and works slightly fasterBuy this

It's light thin portable and it does its job very well
Certainly cools down my laptop which used to get awfully warm after some time
The Targus Chill Pad worked well for about six months
One of the fans has already started to make that tell tale grinding noise
You know that sound the one just before the cooling fan dies
I would like to see a pad made of a more rigged material that heat sinks
A pad designed for wide screen laptops would be niceWith all that said the Targus pad does keep my laptop cooler
It just needs some design tweaking
I received my Chill Pad in such a short period of time
After inspecting it I instantly took it and placed it under my notebook
I could feel an immediate differenceI recommend this to any one who has a notebook
It is compact enough to fit in my briefcase light weight easy to handle and plug in
It is also quite sturdyI had shopped for along time for a cool pad and I am most proud I purchased this one
And have to give thanks for the quick mailing from the seller
PROPS TO YOUIf I should need another Chill Pad I know what to buy and who I would like to buy it from
The cooling pad is really light and two fans gives enough air circulation to effectively cool even my DELL laptop
Without this I cannot work with my laptop on my lap 

I bought this along with case and returned next day because base is too small and can't work right with notebook I have
I've gone through 2 of these with a Dell notebook
It is definitly not a long-term solution to an overheating problem or a preventative measure
I would recommend only using it if you are just trying to get your notebook to last a few months longer until you can replace it
I have noticed a marked improvement in the performance of my laptop since using the chill pad
I use my laptop at home a lot and it is frequently left on for several days at a time
I noticed before that my laptop was becoming very hot around the area where the processor is located especially if I had been typing for some time
This was having a negative effect on my laptops performance
While using the chill pad the constant air flow on the bottom of the laptop is quite adequate to keep the computer cool and also keeps it from damaging my desk
This product does exactly what it is supposed to
It lifts the laptop to a better position for airflow and more ergonomic typing and it also allows you to easily rotate the laptop
It is also small enough to tuck in a laptop bag in contrast to some of the other laptop pads
I bought this for my husband for his new laptop and now he *never* puts the laptop down directly on a table or desk - he always puts the CoolPad down first
It's a small unit
I have a 15" Macbook Pro and I can't use it
I'm just gonna give it to someone with a Macbook
I whish they made them to work with a 15 or 17" Macbook Pro
Targus PA248U Notebook Chill PadThis product is a waste of money
No matter if I use my laptop for a little while or for a long period of time
It still I have had the pad for about 11 months and it always has a problem
The fans don't even line up with ANY laptop's internal fan
The wire is cheapy and therefore you have to pinch move it around tug on it for the connection to be made
Don't waste your money
Buy any other cooling pad with larger fans and even on an incline which allows for best airflow
For some reason I miscalculated size of this pad
It is shorter that my notebook
I think spec should state clearly what is supported size of laptop
Anyway it is working and when fans is blowing air it actually cool down laptop
Unfortunately quality of fans is low
At start up fans makes a lot of noise and it takes few min to go noise away
I am expecting fan to get stuck very soon
This fan was great for the first 3 months of so with daily use but today it just fell apart
The power chord connecting to the fan became dislodged from the input
In other words the chord randomly separated and ceased to work
I suppose you get what you pay for and I am convinced spending an extra ten dollars will be worth it in the long run
If you don't have a lot of money but have a hot Dell like me you're going to want to buy this
It does make a huge difference in cooling down the computer
I recommend turning it on before you turn on your computer it works much better if you give it a head start
If you play games or are just on the computer for long periods of time this is a great way for the money to cool down your computer
The product they are selling out is totally different from what u get  i don't say it's bad  i believe it's a never model  and might be better  i have bein using is for only a couple of days so don't be able to tell the exact performance 
 but seems descent the real test would be if it lasts  i am writing this review only to let people know that product u get is different from imageThe things that are different1
Thicker2
More Stylish  has curved sides 3
More nosier than expected4
Cooling may be some what be better than the last modelThe Specification has also changed Dimension 105''x125''x097''Weight  125lbFan Speed 2500 RPMAir Flow  36 CFMNoice level &lt 233dB
The fan is a little louder than I'd like but is fine in an office environment
I'd pay more for a quieter unit or one with a heat sensor if this was for home
Rubber pads on top and bottom keep everything in place
Air is pulled in from the side and escapes from the side
I'd think you'd want air in or out the back since that's where most batteries areI use this from my MacBook and the internal fan hasn't gone on over 2 days use then it used to kick in at least once a day
So cheap way to keep from stressing out the internal fan
Really great value for the moneykeeps it cool & off the lap tooPLUS good warranty also
I bought this about a year ago and it worked great for my small 12" computer
I play a lot of games so i really needed something that would cool my computer down by a lot
I liked it but i traveled with it and it was fine
the only thing you need to look out for is the cord
its long so keep it tied up
its also not that durable
not the cooler itself but the cord
My cord started falling apart about 3 months ago and now its broken
I had it for a year
Im not getting this one again even if its cheap and works great only because i want something that will last me at least 2 yrs
I received a different chill pad than the one pictured
It is a very undurable plastic and one of the fans is already making noise after 3 weeks
It does not cool well on a flat surface such as a desk so the only useful purpose is if you have it on your lap
You get what you pay for I suppose but I would not suggest it if you have te extra $20
I bought the Targus PA248U Chillpad
The fan is very noisy and after a week the left side fan is making a loud buzzing noise
Got it for a great price $13 but wouldn't buy it again
We have a Targus PA248UX for another laptop
Its much better
The pad does a good job keeping my laptop from getting overly hot before the pad the stickers on the bottom of the laptop were turning black
However it is made of plastic and somehow during transport it has cracked both on the outside grill & on one fan inside
After shaking the loose fan chip out of the inside now the thing runs harder so the labtop vibrates which isn't wonderful
My other complaint is that the USB cord is unecessarily long -- if the pad is for a laptop what do you need a 3-foot-long cord for?
It just gets in the way
I've had this cooling pad for a couple of months now and I haven't had a problem with it yet
I like to have my laptop on my bed when I'm at home and it used to be a problem with the heat that it generated
I used to prop up my laptop on books and have a fan blow underneath it to try and cool it off but it didn't work
After a while I couldn't deal with the heat and I went out and bought this chill pad
I have to say that it has made it so my laptop is completely cool just like it is when it is off and I never have a problem with using my laptop in bed anymore
At first it feels kind of cheap and that you could break it very easily but it is surprisingly sturdy and has no problem supporting my laptop
Overall this has exceeded my expectations with no problems and I would highly recommend it to anyone
I have an HP dv9000 that I use daily for rendering video and playing games
The laptop was running hot to the point of lock ups and hard reboots
I bought this product my first cooling pad and it has done the job wellI agree with "monkeyboy" in that it would be nice to have the fans further back but with some trial and error I found the right spot to get maximum cooling
Good value and great product
Almost completely silent - had another brand that was very noisy which I replaced with the Targas
Highly recommend this pad
I bought this and it quit working after a month
Beware quality issues
Also I have a 17 inch screen laptop and cannot find a chill pad other than for a 14" or so although that's not why I gave the one star rating it still was a problem sometimes being that much smaller than my laptop
If you only work on a flat tabletop it should do fine
The month it worked it did work pretty well and I had no overheating issues while using it
So if you're willing to risk the low quality manufacturing of this product it might be OK
Let me first say that the pictured version the light silver one is an EXCELLENT product
I've been using it with a Fujitsu T4010 laptop for almost a year but it works great even on widescreen 154" laptops
It's whisper quiet vents all the air out the back and is not dependent on airflow from underneath whatsoever
Some reviewers have commented on poor positioning of the fansthat's actually a non-factor due to the air channels which allow a small amount of air to constantly flow past the bottom of your laptop - and that's really all that's needed to keep heat from building up
I use my laptop to edit video which used to make it scorching hotand even with normal use I had to keep a phone book under it though even that got warm on the bottom after some time
The old version though thin and light enough to take anywhere even coach class on a Regional Jet made my laptop feel cool to the touch
I've been using As a bonus it drew a very negligible amount of power which at most cut down battery life by a few minutesNow the bad news One day the engineering and marketing teams at Targus got together and were really bored
Apparently the ER surgeons of the USA were telling them to stop stealing their business by preventing burn injuries  so they decided to make their "redesign" so terrible that no one would want to use itI discovered this when I ordered the pictured item for some friends off of Amazon I'm their "PrimePimp"They sent me the "new improved" one twice
The old one sucked the air down and blew it all out of the backthe new one blows it up which causes the air to spread around which can still make you warm if it's on your lap
Also it's MUCH louder drains the battery of my laptop much more and heavier thicker etcI could use the old one in classes with no one noticing but the new one is loud to the point that you'd be embarrassed to have it in public
It's definitely not something that's portable due to its heft and awkward size
Another problem is that it draws air from the bottomso if you have loose clothing are placing it on a couch etc the air intake will get blockedLastly the fins aren't shielded well and they aren't built well
I had a few blades take flight and one of them made a nice scuff on my laptopI hope that they either 1 Bring back the old version or 2 At least change the picit's very misleading of Targus to keep the same model number for a product that is in no way alike
That's like ordering a Lexus ES350 and getting a Toyota Carolla and the dealer justifying it by saying "Wellthey both do the same thing and are both made by the same company
"The pictured version is at W@l-M@rt it's worth a test drive and the extra price
I'm just thankful for Amazon's great customer support and gracious return policyShame on you Targus Shame on you
I've heard this product has been discontinued which would be no surprise since it is reasonably priced effective and low-tech/no maintenance
It is lightweight swivels smoothly through 360 degrees to allow multiple viewers to see the laptop screen tilts the laptop just enough forward to allow better cooling and ease strain on the wrists
Pretty dang good for a $20 bill
Hope rumors of its extinction are exaggerated but I wish I'd bought two just in case
This is what I wanted
It keeps my laptop cool and works as expected
Laptop stays cool with this on
I can hear it in a quiet house
I purchased the coolpad to use at meetings
I take notes on my computer and it gives the proper leverage and comfort I need while taking the notes
I recommend it for those who use a laptop all the time
This is my second Targus chill mat and my last
The first one lasted 9 months and even though it was still under warranty I didn't bother to return it
I think they count on it being too much of a hassle
While it was working I usually had to jiggle the power cord to get the fans going
The second chill mat didn't work from day one
Not even blowing on the fans made them move
Returning to seller for refund
Any suggestions for a replacement?Note item pictured and ordered is not what I received
Actually received PA248YO3U with a sticker attached to package with upc code for PA248U
I love the Targus PA248U Notebook Chill Pad
It does all that I had anticipated it would do and I would highly recommend it
Very awesome cooler for the price
It cools well and runs pretty quietly
My laptop fans don't need to run as much or as high speed now
Very pleased with the purchase
I actually loved this item so you can imagine how sad I was when it stopped workingI have purchased laptop cooling pads from different companies and unfortunately none of them have worked for more than a few monthsI chalk it up to cheap products made in ChinaIf anyone has purchased a laptop cooling pad that has lasted and is still going strong please let me know
This product is just as is advertised
i wanted something to help cool my 13" Macbook without getting too fancy with fans
i don't know a lot about computers but i knew this '07 laptop needed help in staying cool
not only did it help keeping it cooler and lessening the internal fan from having to kick on all the time at full speed but it is a nice platform you can adjust to your liking and relieves stress on your wrists from typing
the moving platform is a GREAT feature
when i video chat it helps find the best lighting without having to move everything
the grips that hold the laptop in place are very good
i have not had a problem with my laptop slipping what so ever
the only thing i do not like and maybe it is because i have a smaller and lighter laptop is that the grip between the platform and the surface you have it on isn't as good
like i said it may be because my laptop is smaller and doesn't have enough weight to push down on to really engage the grips
every time i rotate the platform it also moves the base
other than that i am very pleased with this product
simple cheap and it works
I am writing to review the Targus Podium CoolPad with 360 degree rotation PA241U
I begin this way because it appears that negative reviews from some Chill Pad products have been placed here with reviews for this Podium CoolPadRight off the top let's be clear Chill pads are laptop stands or pads that have a fan or fans
Often the fans run off of usb power
They are intended to direct air flow to the bottom of the laptop to aid in its coolingIn contrast the Targus Podium Coolpad is different
It has no fans
It does what the item description says it does it helps improve cooling of your laptop by lifting it up off the surface of your desk or table thereby allowing greater air circulation
It also protects your desk or table by preventing heat from you laptop from damaging the finish
In addition it allows you to place your laptop on an angle best suited for your needsThere is only one screw on the coolpad and that is where the upper part of the coopad is attached to the lower part
The screw acts as a pivot so you can turn or rotate your laptop without removing from the pad or moving the bottom of the pad where it sits on your desk
This is nice if someone comes over to you and you want to show them something on your screenI have purchase three of these now and have used one continuously for almost six years
I have had no issues with its durability or functionality
I looked at other products but I like the Podium Coolpad because it's built solid the laptop stays in place without danger of sliding off and I can adjust the angle that suits meThe podium works by stacking some round plastic disks at the far end of the pad
The more you add the greater the angle
There is a plastic bar that you can place over the top of the disks -- it has some non skid pads on it that actually work to keep the laptop from slipping or sliding
There are some non skid round pads at the lower end of the pad to rest the laptop on as well
I'm using it with a 15" screen laptop and it fits fine
From examining the design of this simple stand I think it would accomodate laptop up to a 17" screen with no problem
A smaller laptop will fit on the podium as wellFor me the only negatives are travel and the price
This coolpad would be bulky to take with you on the road
The list price seems a little high for a product made from molded plastic
However the thing does what it's intended to do and does it well
And right now the Amazon price is quite good--I wish this price had been available when I bought my others
Like the previous reviewer I too did not get the one that is in the main picture
I should have got one that has curves/contours on the sides but this one i got is perfectly rectangle
Plus get this the packaging that came with the one they sent doesnt even look like the one they sent
The packaging and instructions looks like the one in the main picture here
Plus the one I should have got has vents on the side
The one i got does not
So beware when u order this
U wont get the item that is in the main picture
Seems like a much inferior replacement they sent instead
Not happy
This product is not as show or described
It looks like a replacement for the Targus Chill Pad that goes into a lap-stand
The model shown is a great Chill Pad that has high speed fans and fits into the Targus stands
However this model is super thin is low speed fans
There is also no room to vent the heat out the sides or top or allow cool air to be blown by the fans
The fans also began to freeze up after a week of use
I ordered two and regret it
Don't let the fake picture fool you this is a low model of Chill Pad and is poorly designed
There are much better models out there such as the actual one pictured
I got it for $12 and it works pretty well
My HP 2510p gets pretty warm after about an hour use and this keeps it pretty cool
It's very light and very quiet
My notebook is 121" and it's a good size fit
I just wish it didn't hog one of my usb ports
But it's pretty good for the price
I own 2 of these chill pads that I purchased for about $10 each
I purchased my first one over 2 years ago and to this day it still works
It has gotten a little noisy but it still does the job
Its parts are cheap but what do you expect for under $10?
I never use the on/off switch which is probably why it still works
If my laptop is on the chill pad is on as well otherwise what is the point of having it?
If I want it off I just unplug it from the usb port
What I like best about this cooling pad is that it draws the heat away from the laptop instead of blowing air up to the laptop to dissipate the heat and in the process blowing dust into your system
Every laptop I have had from my old VAIO S560 to my current one the Dell Inspiron Duo has remained cool while using this cooling pad
Some dust does get on the bottom of the laptop but it's minimal easily wiped away and isn't blown into the laptop
The only thing I would add to this setup would be to make it a usb hub as well
Seems like all the new cooling pads that have additional usb ports blow air up to cool instead of drawing heat out
Not only is it small sturdy and lightweightyou simply MUST get the CoolPadIt swivels so sharing is eaiserIt allows air to circulate while allowing you to put your laptop on your lap without the heatIt levels the laptop so typing is betterMy laptop dosen't make the big fan noise anymoreBest add-on you can buy
I use this with my 17" Powerbook and it works great
It lets more air circulate under the computer so it doesn't get too warm and the ability to swivel it around is nice too
The pad also tilts the computer slightly forward so typing is comfortable
It is a nice thing to have if you are using a laptop at a desk or table
It works sure but it's thin plastic with a small on off button that broke within the first week of use
I bought three of these one for my one for my boyfriend and one for his sisteras Targus is a good name
Two stopped working within 3 months and the 3rd stopped working in 4
Waste of money
I've had the Targus Chill Pad for about 2 months now and I say thumbs down
Money can be spent on a more worthy cooler
The adapter part that plugs into the cooling pad often gets to have a poor connection thus shutting off the fans
Also plastic = bad
Heat dissipation was alright when I first bought it but nowit's not performing up to task
Why?
THE FANS BLADES BROKE OFF
The left fan is missing one blade and the right fan is missing two blades
Like I said plastic = bad
Spend your money on an aluminum cooling padpreferably with ball-bearing fansResearch before you buy

I bought one of these shortly after Christmas to keep my laptop cool
Although it did a good job of keeping my laptop from overheating I was very dissatisfied with the cordI have had to return it twice in less than two months because of breaks in the cord once by the on/off switch once by the plug
I was very optimistic to receive this item because my computer often overheats
I am a college student so I do a lot of work using my laptop
The cooling pad itself is a little small for my Dell Inspiron 1150 this causes the fans on the cooling pad to be located closer to the front than where they need to be in the back
The product was difficult to get working but after I fiddled with the cord and the switch for a while it did come on
However I have had the cooling pad for less than a week and it has already completely quit working
I would not recommend purchasing this product
The Targus Podium Coolpad delivers as promised
It lets you position your laptop at an optimal angle for your wrists and eyesThe extra spacing gives your laptop base fans room to vent warm air
And the stable-feeling two-piece Podium base swivels nicely on a table-topThe unit comes with a bar-like attachment to contact the bottom of your laptop but I found that the four rubber-topped posts were more than enough for my 14-inch Toshiba
You may think you are paying a lot for a molded piece of rubber and plastic but the Podium does the job nicely
In this case simplicity works
I purchased the Podium Coolpad PA241U to elevate my MacBook Pro 154" at a higher angle than was afforded by the height of my desk
Combined with the Wireless Mighty Mouse and Apple Wireless Keyboard this device perfects my work spaceThe re-sizeable plastic columns on the back are circular and fit neatly on top of one another with no snapping or twisting
The tops of each column have heat-resistant and gripping rubber capsThe base of the pad where the edge nearest the notebook user sits also has such rubber pieces that hold the notebook in placeThe base does indeed swivel but stays put when you want it toI highly recommend this to anyone who finds themselves leaning over their desk to type on their laptop keyboard and wants to improve their overall notebook experience
My favorite aspect of the product is by far the way it brings the laptop screen to eye levelAs a sidenote if one so desired one could turn the podium around so that the laptop keyboard angles down and away from the user in an effort to improve the circulation in one's wrists
At first the chill pad worked really well and kept my notebook cool
But the fans stopped working after only a month
I was not happy with the product
